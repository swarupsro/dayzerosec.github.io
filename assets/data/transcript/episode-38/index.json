Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with me a zi as well as anti because the anti is with us. We're going to be front loading the podcast with some of the more threat Intel related topics. So we'll jump right into those because anti he's not going to be with us for the full episode is going to be with us for about probably like 20 or 30 minutes or so. I'm guessing so we'll just we'll jump into the first topic he wanted to bring up which is cognizant suffering maze ransomware cyber attacks. So anti would you be able to jump into that one? Because I haven't really I didn't get a chance to look at that one too much did it some other topics but I know you wanted to bring this one up. So I'll let you jump into it.\", \"start\": 16.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, give me one second to pull up the link here is having a little bit technical issues. But yeah, so the maze ransomware for anyone who's not aware of what this is why it matters. So maze ransomware is one of the groups that is pretty prolific right now. They're one of the first groups that Equally, once they hit you with ransomware, they would post your company's information on their little website and then force you to pay because all your information is exposed. Right? So it's it's another type of ransomware. They don't just encrypt everything but they also publish it until you pay them. So what's fascinating is they've actually spawned a whole bunch of recent ransomware variants that like have caused, you know them to change their way of thinking so things like the limb and empty. I'm sure these all sound like archaic names to some people but Actually, it's kind of changed the business model of how ransomware is working at present. So maze ransomware recently hit organization called cognizant. I believe about use them. So but I know that they're pretty large and so I thought it was fascinating to see that even these like huge kind of it organizations that no matter how many preparations you have in place, right especially for an organization that manages other people's infrastructure, you know the risk of being hit by something like ransomware as pretty steady and you know you Guys kind of\", \"start\": 58.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" so I actually I want to bring up question with that. It seems to me like the standing recommendation has generally been to just pay the ransom Ware that runs more generally at least like, you know, you pay it you do get your content decrypt and you're good to go it has that been true or am I misinformed\", \"start\": 137.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so it's a little bit of both, right? You know, like because I thought the\", \"start\": 157.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" FBI. Yeah. I thought the FBI had given the advice is just simply just At\", \"start\": 162.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, they definitely so you'll hear like the info seconds tribute. Like don't pay them you're paying criminals and so on but the FBI yet, they've admitted that basically what are you going to do? Right? So yes realistically if you want your information decrypt it is going to you're going to have to likely pay most of these ransomware variants people haven't figured out like it's just incription, you know what I mean? So it's secure and it's sense that the way they're going about it usually would like two sets of keys. You're not going to be able to like decrypt that content yourself and the the hard part is, you know, Even a third party company like they talked to the threat actors or whatever the hell you want to come for you. It doesn't change the fact that you're craps encrypted. So, you know the hardest part actually that most people deal with is not even paying for it because it's trivial for multi, you know hundreds of millions of dollars a company entrance that much it's actually that like the decryption itself right takes like months because it's slow and they're usually pretty crappy. So that's the caveat. Is that even if you pay them and you're losing like I've known some organizations lose like three to five million Day because everything is encrypted. It doesn't you know, it doesn't the sad part is even if you pay it it still takes two months your now losing, you know, in excess of you know hundreds of millions of dollars you have an if you pay the fair\", \"start\": 168.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" point on that. I was more wondering if it was really necessary to publish the information to encourage payment because it seemed to me as somebody that hasn't been you know impacted by ransomware haven't been involved with company that's been impacted by ransomware. It seemed to me like generally they they were paying it. So you didn't need further encouragement to pay so just seemed like that that extra step just seems unnecessary to me.\", \"start\": 239.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I think it's because nowadays like you get some organizations that will go and publicly say like I'm not going to pay this right. So it's more of an incentive that if you want the trouble to stop like this group specifically maze I'd have to pull up their website right now, but they have it where there's a group that they think is compromised January that refused to pay right and even though they refuse to pay this group. May's group has still continued to kind of trash talk and tell them that like, you know, this group doesn't care and that you know, that made it a point that it doesn't just go away because you don't offer to pay the whole reason for that is to continue to post your information and you know, the legality of it of having that information out there kind of puts you in a weird spot, right?\", \"start\": 264.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, I could see where you know definitely adds a pressure and I could understand company that decides not to pay. I mean, it's similar, you know with paying for a kidnapping since you're paying the criminals. You're basically just encouraging the action further.\", \"start\": 304.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It's kind of like that. But associate with terrorists, yeah. Oh,\", \"start\": 319.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah. No, I mean you're right and idea that it honestly, like does it make a big difference your stuff's going to be encrypted one way or another probably not but I think the different ideas that they give them like two weeks to go and say if you don't want this in the news and blahbitty blah, well then just pay us now, right? Otherwise, that's when you see them publish it so then you don't just have two bad guys to worry about right you've now got the stress of media Outlets who wait for stuff like To happen harassing you you've got researchers and every single person annoying the crap out of you and when they publish it like most ransomware groups, if they're you know, just trying to stay low down they'll just encrypt the information right and then kind of annoys you about it to decrypt it if they have like these groups are taking that information as well. So then you run the risk of Bill now give it to all the other criminals, right?\", \"start\": 323.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I definitely see where like a match. I definitely see where the pressure is coming from on that side. Like I see what's novel about this. This it was just kind of had that question about you know, it's a really necessary and I guess 0.2 go. Yeah, it does make a practical difference against those companies that might try and stand up to it a little\", \"start\": 368.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" bit. Yeah, now that's that's kind of my you know synopsis really is just that I thought that this was interesting because of the fact that like I know lots of people talk about ransomware and stuff and kind of understand how it works, but I don't know. I just thought it was like old-school gangster type stuff where it's like, okay, I'm not just going to encrypt all your crap. Like I'm going to make it known that I've encrypted all your stuff and your clients are going to hate like, you know, it's just for\", \"start\": 388.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" protection, you know going with that protection racket of the mafia.\", \"start\": 414.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" If you let your neighbors know that I broke your windows and I fixed them to and if they don't want an Ali.\", \"start\": 420.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" One thing I did notice just scrolling down the page a little bit is you know, they're saying that it should be treated as a data breach because there is an encrypted files being stolen. So like does that mean technically that under gdpr any companies that operate in Europe have to disclose when they're hit by ransomware now, like I never really liked I know gdpr is kind of a weird topic because it's pretty\", \"start\": 428.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" vague, even if they weren't even if the files were being taken. I think just the fact that they would have been X or whooping access by the malware doing the encryption would be enough to Warrant the data breach\", \"start\": 453.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" alert. Okay. Yeah, it was just something that I never really thought about it like obviously but you know if this is dumped on the on the web or something then that constitutes a data breach but just like it's a breach when it's\", \"start\": 466.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" accessed. So what exactly happens from there, you know, it takes time to figure out what exactly happens in attack figure out what was actually taken in South bow the moment\", \"start\": 478.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's access its breached.\", \"start\": 489.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" At least as far as I know obviously, I'm not a lawyer. We're not lawyers on here. But she's\", \"start\": 492.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" providing. Will your advice right now? That's what\", \"start\": 497.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yes, that's that's how you can take this run your company based off of my advice. I would highly recommend it. But yeah, as far as I'm aware of GDP are as soon as that axis happened it sort of breaks and we've kind of seen that with well with that shot off. I think we talked about a few episodes back. That one shop that got compromised and the white hat hacker who was acting fairly dark was kind of trying to leverage that saying they needed to disclose the breach because because he had access regardless of the fact that he had made a public yet. Did you have anything further to kind of add on\", \"start\": 499.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" that? The only thing I would say is that you know to throw a little shade I think talking about gdpr and certain things. I'm not saying that companies aren't reporting it. But I do get this feeling that you know, because I've looked into some of these compromises and stuff like that. I'm very comfortable saying that there's probably some companies who aren't reporting like they're supposed to I can't name and shame because I don't know for sure. I think there's no hard to fix. Aren't necessarily aware yet. They need to be reporting all the\", \"start\": 542.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" time or of was level they need a report at and that's not an excuse. It is one of the things I appreciate with GPR is I do think you know companies need to be more responsible about disclosing when informations been breached. So like I agree with GDP are kind of pushing that although I do realize it adds a little bit extra work for like the small businesses and stuff, but Yeah, I definitely agree. There are there are going to be companies that aren't necessarily alerting on the base of a breach part of that's going to come down to being able to detect the breach small business isn't necessarily going to have the same skills to actually detect. Hey, they've been breached. I do think this is an interesting case because they you were mentioning about it taking months to decrypt if it's taking months to decrypt. It's probably taking a while to encrypt all so they're probably sitting on there for a while this particular. Page from bleeping computer mentions that attackers were likely on the network for weeks.\", \"start\": 572.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, and I don't wanna interrupt Specter. I know he probably had some say so if you want to throw your hat into the mix real quick Specter, I did have a response to that though. Zi.\", \"start\": 631.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. What I just wanted to say was with the GDP our Point specifically even though it technically Viola GDP are not disclosing if these kinds of breaches happen. The problem is how much is it actually enforced? You know, I don't have the data laid out for that, but I Imagine they're probably not really aggressively enforcing\", \"start\": 638.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" us. So actually gdpr does have some bite. I couldn't I wasn't expecting a name any particular instances, but there have been some significant fines around gdpr. So I would say that it does have a bite. Okay Fern I couldn't say in particular sure because I mean there's also the case of if they don't alert that there's a bridge how do you even find out that\", \"start\": 658.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" there was a breach\", \"start\": 679.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean depending on the type of criminals that actually did the bridge they're not necessarily going to be dumping it or how it gets you. Is might not be clear. So I mean, I'm sure there are companies that can get away without reporting because the criminals just have to kind of keep it quiet. They had the data from this Source or you couldn't actually isolate what the source of the information was.\", \"start\": 680.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Now that's probably a fair point and I think you know, I mean, it does have a little bit of bite, you know, if you look at Facebook and I think even Google have been sued based on GDP are or find I should say not suit the find based on those. So I mean it does have an impact now. Like you kind of talked about Specter how big of an impact again a mom and pop shop. Are you going to go drag him through the mud and stabbed him in the leg like how dare you know, like, you know, who knows how deep it really goes if it's not a big big company, but you know to kind of summarize on one point Z, it does happen that most of these campaigns and once that I've even seen, you know, it doesn't just happen overnight like oh no, you know, I went and walked away for coffee and my whole network isn't Clint completely encrypted like it. Isn't to my knowledge. I haven't seen anything like that. But the problem is usually a lot of these companies, you know, just I think even there's a I don't know if stop my head maybe I can provide a link there was some government agency. I think of something with the power grid in South America that basically like gigabytes if not terabytes of information was siphoned out and stuff like that. So all these people don't have any cognizant idea of like the initial state which is usually the loader right? So these things start with like a very basic malware, Are not necessary basic but one that's just meant to drop more malware, right? So trick bought and a few other variants then it kind of sets and Scopes out the network then it's like multi stage is where they go and run things. Like I don't know if it was Powershell Empire, but there's definitely a few things like Cobalt strike some of the stuff that like pentesters use they'll go and like compromise all kinds of other servers and active directory and stuff like that to get as much access as they can. So normally it probably takes about a week but they have there has been some research that I've shown like some of these campaigns the second they get a foothold through like Like RDP or something. It'll take them like 48 hours to map out your network and then drop like something like Ryu quic then just encrypts everything so long story short. Usually if you have really good liquid setup, you can maybe catch this in the early stages, but unfortunately, it doesn't seem to matter and malware just I me and that's kind of\", \"start\": 700.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" a wider issue in general. There's a little bit of once you're through the perimeter. There's just trust trust everybody that's kind of inside the perimeter and that's a mistake. I think for a lot of companies that have that type of network setup, but that generally Wide what? It is, especially on smaller side, once you're in you're in and then you kind of just have maybe they're you know zi mention 80 and stuff. But like maybe there's a little bit more access control, but it's very soft once you're inside. But I think I do want to get on to the other topic before you have to take off. So if you're good with you, but go ahead. Let's hear it. Yeah. Well, so the other topic is the well potentially here from Vice hackers are selling a critical Zoom. Zero-day exploit for $500,000\", \"start\": 823.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" zooming back into the news. Of course. Yes, of\", \"start\": 870.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" course soon.

We've been seeing governments actually being recommended to and moving away from using Zoom as well.

You're like actually Lee I usually find that it's worth less in the underground because it's not like most cybercriminals dude or spending $500,000 for next week. That's insane.

So this is somebody that has gone and done that has documented the process and while he doesn't don't think he doesn't call it out, but it was fairly consistent with what last past has put on that's just the positive sign.

I won't drop any names in particular, but I remember being on another twitch stream and the guy just meant like, you know, if you're letting the cloud know all your passwords or something. You're just doing it wrong. There's it was something like that where you basically had the idea that password managers actually knew what your passwords or and how LastPass Works how be awarded Works how basically any of the cloud or centralized storage password managers work any of the big ones, at least I'm so I'm sure there's some random one that's just implemented stupidly. But they don't know all of your information. They encrypt they basically just store this encrypted blob that is only decrypted on your side. They have separate keys to do your authentication to authenticate the you're allowed to see that blob versus being able to actually decrypt The Blob the keeps guys split up into three parts stored in different places. And you're the only one that actually brings them together with your master password. That's kept local of long story short. Basically this what I thought His interest here is just he found you know, a lot of consistency with what we've been informed about and in theory, this is somebody else.

It's also an extra step of work more talking about kind of getting everybody in the masses using it. Something like LastPass is far more convenient than being to make sure you always have that encrypted database around. That's said that is still a better step. I'll but at this point, I don't think the world's ready for that to be the default recommendation. It's not that I disagree with that recommendation.

I believe that said when we're talking so I pulled up the screenshot. This is from Rob emporiums Bad characters challenge. Somebody actually on the re Discord server kind of pointed pointed out some other things with that particular challenge that'll bring up but in terms of the code block, so you'll see here that Don't use curly braces around anything. They just do indentation. So so I can understand why people are like, oh, I don't like that code style. You're not writing this code though. You're only going to read it. And the reality is that adding those braces is purely because this isn't see. I mean there's other things. I've make this Nazi you're not writing this your only need to read at the only thing that those braces will add is empty lines. That's the only thing it adds.

It's not going to be without issues but it's going to get that maturity over time and as we've seen with with Benjo with other features, they don't just drop something and then stop working on it. I imagine this decompiler is going to be worked on for years. It's going to be an ongoing thing and as it matures, you know, it's going to get better and as an initial initial starting point, I think this is great.

Yeah. That's it. Here's I am going to pull out a few. Rights, here are a few other issues that we've noticed. So I pulled up the graph you now. This is what you'll see if you use cloud and this is I was mentioning earlier about how the cloud isn't quite the same. So this is that same Bad characters or what was the function call. I think it was like check Bad characters or something is the function name from The Bad characters Rob Emporium challenge if you were paying attention on the video before or if you can't see anything what we see right here with a graph as we see a while loop and we see the VAR being incremented at the base. We see those think what would you see the two increments actually because it's a double for Loop but it treats them in the graph view as wild Loops. Whereas in the linear view, which you do not get in in the free version right now and Cloud. It gives you the four Loops. It gives you something that in my opinion is much more readable than what you see in the graph View. That's interesting. So it basically it seems like a prefers to decompile as a while loop when you're seeing the graph which kind of makes sense because those like parts of the for happening different areas. So make sense to show how things jump around in that whereas the linear view makes a little bit more sense to just show it as is like I kind of get where that came from, but it is worth noting because I did see some complaints about not picking up for loops and I think that's Why I think it's because for those basically only show up when you're in the\", \"start\": 2997.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" linear View. That's really interesting. I never noticed that but yeah, that being said I do want to bring up that tomorrow night probably at like 8:00 p.m. Eastern. I will be doing a stream looking at Benja because I haven't personally since I don't have a commercial license, I'm not balling out that hard but um, you know, I'm going to be looking at the decompiler and comparing it to geed ra seeing like where it's better and trying to check out some of the complaints that I've seen see how much like Merit they have and whether there's a way around it and stuff like that. So I am going to be Doing a string that's going to be exploring that tomorrow. So I do just want to shout that out just in case I forget to show to their to the begin at the end of the episode as well. So, you know just for anybody that's interesting that I will be doing a stream about that and we will probably be doing a more polished video that looks at it, you know without all the you know things that come in the string. We're going to be doing a video on that too. So be on the lookout for that. Yeah. Something\", \"start\": 3092.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" said. Yeah, go ahead.\", \"start\": 3146.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was thinking we'll probably move into more of the CTF. So\", \"start\": 3148.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" actually I want to go on with one. Are really big issue and that is brutal. Okay. Well, so this is like I'm going to say this is probably personally I see this is something that's going to get fixed very quickly. But if you take a look this check Bad characters function notice the start if at the bar 28 equals 0 x 62, yeah and the for Loop just kind of uses the relative act like it but it's basically looping through the indexes for each character in 4H back. Character if you look at the ml IL though for this function, we noticed something really important, which is that the ml IL has a bunch of assignments earlier on it has the far 20 a far 2726 it assigns the entire array because this is obviously a array being declared on the stack. So it's doing that initialization there as you call in the function at setting up the entire stack with all of the bad characters. Oh decompiler completely optimizes that now Is it is there in the ml I also like it knows it's there. So this seems like something that because the actual Loops only access these indirectly. It doesn't really associate them together. So it's a failure on their part. It seems like a failure that's more like an optimization thing where it's like, oh, hey these variables are he is let's just not show them. It seems like an overzealous optimization that can be tamed back a little bit rather than a really significant. Issue with the decompiler, but it is there right now like that is a huge issue. It just seems to me like it's something that can and will be fixed pretty quickly. But yeah, I just want to point that one. I would also because like that it that's that's a pretty serious issue to be missing\", \"start\": 3151.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that but that is a good example though of why you should never completely trustee compiler output alway and especially with ginger because you have access to those other intermediate levels.

And I guess to end on a positive note one of my favorite things. It's super small, but I just I just love kind of the fact that it's there and this happens in ml il-2 is they will preface the comparison. So like less than equal to greater than or whatever with a you were in s letting you know, if it's a signed or unsigned\", \"start\": 3277.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" comparison that is really nice.\", \"start\": 3319.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" And I mean, that's something you kind of lose when you go to see it's just not there unless you know the types and you know how they're going to get upgraded down gray, whatever to know how that's going to get compared.\", \"start\": 3321.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I said the reason that's really useful is like there are absolutely sinus issues that can lead to some pretty serious bugs and overflows.

I think overall, you know, it's been well-received. I'll say that yeah, it was a cool idea that they dropped it with the CTF as well though. I do wonder how many serious teams would want to switch up their tools like at the last minute, you know an hour before the CTF, but, you know, they're probably worth some and they probably got some useful.

I don't like 16 hours possibly more of good hard work into that challenge and could not could not solve it. So I I just want to I call it out its catalog. I don't know if they release their challenges if they do that. That would be a fun one to go back to the solutions. Actually pretty cool. Like I did kind of figure out by the end.

I never felt like the challenge was unfair and that's that was actually really impressive because usually if there's a web challenge and like I'm banging my head for that long odds are it's some sort of guess work or something, but I was always finding little things that I can maybe abuse.

They allowed to be uploaded is SVG files, which allow JavaScript so using that you can basically get an xss. Now.

I forget what the Mind type is now, but it's just using like that URL encoded like chi chi equals value kind of setup. Whereas with multi-part it's definitely more complicated setup. He giveth the The boundary and then that's kind of used to separate so you can send more binary data. You can send larger packs about that.

So, you know, like you were the one that signed it you validate that's a valid token and it'll include things like grants information for like what they're actually allowed to do or you can include a variety of things but the basic idea Is that it's just as a really lightweight way to do with Education Without need to query dead based on every page request. There are some downsides with that. I'm not a big fan of there are a lot of ways. You can shoot yourself in the foot using tokens. So while it definitely has some uses you've got to be careful. It's a lot like crypto in general. You've got to be careful with it because you never want to issue a token. That doesn't expire for example Back in 2015 a big issue was you could also just kind of create create a token and insert the algorithm saying well, what's the signing algorithm? Oh, I didn't sign it at algorithm none and give it all the grants you want and if something just check if it was a ballad token and that it had the right grant and didn't actually validate that it was signed by who they expected to be signed who they expected to be signed by. using the non algorithm is you can basically create your own tokens so in this case off the zero they obviously as most places have they've disallowed using the none algorithm I don't get why not algorithm was even included in the first place maybe development purposes stupid thing to use like you're never going to want to use that in practice like I can't I cannot think of any legitimate reason to use none anyway they banned not and by checking off the algorithms not but they checked it in a case sensitive way so you can set it to done with the capital e and allow you to use the none algorithm again.

The problem is in their protocol. The implementation is actually vulnerable to a new line injection. So you can do something like example.com back / or / backslash n host equals github.com.

And the one they ended up looking at was the component-based servicing session. So part of what made this cool is they show a way that they first exploited it and then they show are they exploited again after Microsoft failed to patching it. So the bug was a arbitrary file disclosure in the icds session 10 interface. They found a bunch of you know, various methods that are attached to that. Interface but to kind of stood out and that was the initialized and create package methods. So the initialize function needs to be called before any other methods can be called, you know, you can kind of speculate that that's going to be the case just based on it being called initialize and you can pass it a boot drive and a Windows directory as well as some other stuff. There are some restrictions the windows directory has to have the directory structure of a typical Windows installation. So it needs a user's folder and needs to contain certain components. I'm guessing I thought they mean like dlls and other folders stuff like that but an attacker with access can can fake that structure and the other thing they can do is they can also create symbolic links which is then copied and is readable by the attacker which can lead to arbitrary file disclosure now Microsoft Patch this last year in November and what they basically try to do is you know look and say okay this is a symbolic link okay we'll just reject this we're not respecting the symbolic link so when they looked at it again after the Patch they noticed an error was being logged but the service was still copying the target file and this was because the boy they checked if the file was a symbolic link they use the get file attributes W method and the win API to check if the attribute is set for the symbolic link and this would work fine if the function worked out the documentation set it worked and the documentation said if the path points to a symbolic link make the function returns attributes for the symbolic link knocked the target file and that turns out to be wrong the it Returns the attributes of the final Target file not the actual symbolic link so because of that there check was essentially useless and it would still end up copying that Target file so this was again finally patched last month so it's just one of those cool things where you can see like just because an issue is patched doesn't mean it was patched correctly so that's one thing and then the other thing is you know you have to kind of question the documentation sometimes yeah liked a\", \"start\": 5483.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" question question the documentation I just thought it was interesting that the two tools that create symlink to on the make link tool had different behaviors there too because that was kind of what the difference there was when a symbolic links crave with the make link tool get file attributes does return the appropriate attributes and includes that file actually reparse point that they're looking for but when you use the create symlink tool the documentation was wrong the documentation indicate that what do that and it doesn't I just I just found that interesting that the two different tools ended up resulting in some different and I'm sure like, it creates a slightly different type of Link because Windows has a bunch of different link types.\", \"start\": 5716.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I was going to say I'm not really a Windows person but I think part of the issue is that there's different types of those thinking Microsoft terminology.

So that makes exploitation so much cleaner and nicer and they basically found another member in the structure that they could corrupt to easily get an arbitrary, right? And because you know that memory is so deterministic. They can also you know, they don't have to worry about ASL are they can defeat a SLR and then they just use that to smash the credential structure of the process to get uid 0 so You know, the exploitation of it is fairly straightforward the actual bugs. It's kind of fun because it sucks about you know, that discrepancy between 32-bit and 64-bit and all the math that goes into that. I do think they could have covered it a little bit better getting those details that I just said took a lot of like mental effort to try to understand what they were trying to say.

They basically have this, you know function that allows you to have a shared buffer between the kernel and Trust Zone which for people who don't know trust Zone. It's a trusted execution environment in the chain of trust. It is higher than Colonel. Technically. If you have Colonel access, you should not be able to mess with anything and trustzone.

I guess it's don't repeat yourself not do not but I'll the dry principle don't repeat yourself. And I think that kind of had came into play with this issue a little bit part of this issue comes down to they're two different cases as Spectre was mentioning about this buffer that's used to communicate with trustzone. Basically your station will allocate this buffer ion buffer that you can use to communicate and there's the function here that's vulnerable is the qse cam update command buffer or the 64-bit version of it and that will basically go and it will translate pointers is effectively the idea turn the pointers take the buffer turn the pointers into something trustzone will understand and it handles two different cases in which the buffers need to be modified and two different eye off dolls end up reaching it in am calling it for two different handlings and that's where I think dry kind of came in here they tried to centralize what was more of an incidental repetition rather than actual repetition that needed to be prevented because winds where you can know this happens is when you start seeing a path where you know at first you have exactly the same code pretty much so hey I'm going to create a function that just you know takes argument and then you'll need to update this function whenever you want to change it and then when you see a flag being added you see something else being ad that will change that methodology that will change how it works that's when you know that you probably shouldn't have actually repeated that function when you start adding those flags that make significant changes it should be a secondary function rather than being just you know combining it so I just wanted to point that out with I feel like that dry idea like you do have to be aware of the idea of incidental repetition where the repetition is there but it's only incidental to what's going on and it's not actually something you should combine into one\", \"start\": 7190.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" function Yeah, one of those things that contributes to this issue is this code would be fine in userland because basically what you were saying with the two different types, they track it through this you'll see it on if anybody watching you'll see it on the screen they say data type.

So, you know, if you have two different octaves that can change the type from underneath the other thread that's Where the race condition comes into play now if this code was sitting in userland this code would probably be fine. The issue comes in where in Colonel it's very easy to have concurrent access and that's where a lot of Kernel driver issues bond from the fact that it's people who aren't familiar with the pitfalls that come with working in Colonel.

So you can have a function that will start with one data type called cause the other eye off to be called changes that data type and it'll end doing the other functionality.

because the the check fails no other parameters are modified and they're not wiped out so it will end up pointing to a previously set ion buffer which is already been freed so it's a classic use after

read primitive to know where to write to because essentially the SMB ghost vulnerability the way they hit it it gave you an out of bounds memory corruption on the Heap through an integer overflow in the decompressed function and you can use that to get an arbitrary kernel right I'm not going to talk about that issue too much just because we already covered that in depth on episodes we talked to it episode 36 but what's important to note there is you can also hit other adjacent data with the memory corruption as well and one thing you can hit for example is like peanut raw buffer or some other member that gets copied to a response because your corruption is in the request packet so to other members contained in the same header are Pointers to mdl structures and mdl for those who don't know it stands for a memory descriptor list and what's important what's important about those is is they contain physical memory pointers so you know when you're talking about kernel-level you have two different types of memory you have virtual memory and physical memory so virtual memory gets mapped to physical memory and it's a lot easier to work with physical memory is the actual the real address if you want to call it that that contains the the data and what's important about that is physical memory is harder to randomize then virtual memory virtual memory with a slrs like that it's a lot easier to deal with and that actually comes into play here there's a reason they went with that ndl method so they fake these mbl's and they K user shared data because they're they're mapped to fix locations and both user land and Colonel so you don't have to deal with a SLR they're mapped in fixed locations so they talk about some of the walls they hit with while doing this and I won't cover all that hear those who are interested are free to look at the right up but suffice it to say they basically get arbitrary physical memory read through that that mdl method now I'm not experienced some windows but apparently hitting the page tables is a common exploit strategy and windows kernel exploitation which kind of makes sense page tables are are pretty powerful to mess with so because of that Microsoft tries randomizing the address of the PML for or page map level for self reference entry and they do that by randomizing the index the problem is that happens at the virtual memory level that doesn't happen at the physical memory level so while the wall the index is randomized the physical address of that entry is not randomized and that's why I was saying you know physical memory can be really powerful to hit at the kernel level if you can do it so it seems bios always had it at a hex one a a000 and UEFI always had it at x 1 AD 0 0 0 so now they can I can basically get arbitrary read write and what they ended up hitting was the hardware abstraction layer how they essentially searched the physical backing memory of the house Heap to find the interrupt controller and smash one of the function pointers for the interrupt controller there are some other challenges even after code execution specifically they highlighted they tried launching a user mode process but they had some struggles with that because Windows user land uses control flow guard CFG but you know I don't want to go into that too too much just because this is a pretty dense right up and I will say you you will probably need some in-depth Windows knowledge to be able to fully appreciate it to fully understand it that's why you know I don't want to go too much into those issues partially because I don't have a strong background in Windows and I don't think he does either so we can't go too much into exactly how all that works I don't want to say like things that are like over the incorrect or anything like that at overall though I thought it was cool right up it's fun to see how an LP e can be turned remote using clever tricks like abusing physical memory like that I don't know if you have any other thoughts on that see\", \"start\": 7683.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah well I mean we always kind Neil was going to be an RC like that there was some way of getting that that's what it was originally reported as the lp was clearly just because they had the right what can they and this is what we talked about in episode 36 like they did LP because they had the right and they had an easy factor to turn that into an LP by grabbing the token or whatever I forget what they did in that one but they had that method so in this case like we just see a you know your workout you go from that are bright you get here read Gadget and keep moving from there just expanding on that it was a good write-up you drop this in like super last minute so I can't have much to say in depth on\", \"start\": 7931.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it well we had it as a shout-out originally but somebody from the re server want me to try to cover it more in depth so that's where I tried to get you know I wanted to read it more in depth so that's that's what happened there I will say though the actual issue that led to the arbitrary right if you're interested in that the post that we covered a few weeks ago does a way better job I think it has like really nice diagrams and it makes it a lot more accessible I don't think this one covered the the bug as well as the other post that being said this one I'm not saying like this one has a lot to offer that method of hitting it remotely it's very interesting and obviously isn't going to be included in the LPE version but just the bug details you might want to check out that other post but overall yeah I think the I think this was a really cool post and it finally demonstrated that it can be hit remotely like Ms were saying\", \"start\": 7974.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah and actually I will just add the link into the description for the other right up also just in case anybody wants it it would be down in the description\", \"start\": 8028.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here okay cool so this time I'm not lying that is our last exploit that we're going to cover you know in depth we will move on to some of our research stuff so our research stuff this week is focused on fuzzing our first one is called I John which is exploring deep State spaces with fuzzing deep State I don't think they mean like you know the intelligence community's\", \"start\": 8037.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" they might but I mean they they're exploring Mario and this case Super Mario Bros one so I mean you never know how The Illuminati's using that\", \"start\": 8062.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you never know so I John is I think it's basically supposed to be like an annotation mechanism that allows humans to guide father's through problems of block a lot of modern fuzzers yeah so that's its own it's not really a fuzzer but it's something that interfaces\", \"start\": 8071.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" with well so it's built on AFL so uses AFL kind of modern fuzzing what they kind of noted here is modern fuzzing you know they look the XY kind neighborhoods of test cases you give it a test case it mutates a test case into something else roughly related to it but there are tons of cases that are just the probability of triggering are randomly is just super small very limited if it's not actually kind of looking for that so what they've introduced here is the idea of being able to do some annotation so it's mixing kind of that code coverage guiding with limited value guided coverage for trying to hit all the different values for something and they provide kind of a good example of kind of the Curren there I think it's either in this or it's in their demo release I don't see it here so much been the other thing so what they kind of use as an example there's getting code coverage on some sort of maze application where all the application does is it basically just has a switch on if you had wasd or you know up down left right it one of those characters it adjusts a single value the xry up or down and that's all it really does so by adding an annotation they're just saying like hey also do we value guided coverage on the X and Y values because getting code coverage you could hit those for code paths up down left right super easily you're going to get a complete code coverage there but you also want to get that coverage of those are all the possible X and Y values which is kind of where they come in adding annotations for that and so by adding an annotation thing like hey these values are also important fuzz those they found they were able to get they use Mario's the example they're able to get much deeper into it into in this case the like said they use Mario trying to be the different levels there if you get much deeper in there and actually complete most levels\", \"start\": 8086.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so if you want to see some of the implementation stuff of like some of the helper functions they provide if you go to page 8 I think you had it up briefly they had like a listing of some of the functions you have so they have like I John comp I John hash in tashman hashtag all that kind of stuff and what you were saying with like testing on Mario they also had a table on the 10th page I want to say yeah the 10th page and they have like this little table comparing AFL well on its own along with I John in the AFL and all the Mario levels that could solve so like you could see AFL it only hit a hundred percent of the distance on a few of the levels where I jotted hit on all of the levels basic or\", \"start\": 8211.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" not most of all levels is that said like I'll mention a I mean yes Super Mario Bros does seem like a bit of a weird yeah but I so doing a ion games isn't that weird though so I don't know I mean it is a little bit of fuzzing like it's definitely a weird Benchmark it's not unheard of though because he do cut you have a goal you have a very particular score like you have some that can prove it's doing that and it's just kind of a test test case of see it's getting deeper into it it's able to get that depth because we tell it to focus on this these particular types of\", \"start\": 8252.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" values it's a lot easier to visualize to like yeah program coverage is a lot harder to visualize for somebody who's not familiar with the contents of the paper\", \"start\": 8294.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" well it's also it's also like the between just code coverage which is just you know the control handle or hit all the buttons and you've got it all the code coverage versus kind of all the different areas also like it's it illustrates the difference between what it's fuzzing\", \"start\": 8303.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" for yeah so I did want to cover some of the observations they made before they got into their implementation details which we just covered I think it I think there's some useful observations there so one thing they found was code coverage is sometimes overestimated and what it provides just because it'll keep hitting irrelevant State changes and that's why they say like a human who can identify and guide those State changes might be more useful which is why they provide those those helper functions and stuff another thing they found was it might not be obvious to a father what can actually influence the state and and to what degree and the last thing was sometimes you don't even have good State information to work with so one example they give is like magic bites for that AFL doesn't really know how to handle those so all of these things the paper authors are you could be improved by you know including an actual person in that equation so I like the idea I do have some questions though like you were saying earlier while Super Mario is fun I don't think it should really be used as a serious Benchmark I'd want to see how this performs and works on larger complex code bases they you know they kind of they say they tested it against a test hashmap implementation and amaze and Super Mario if they're going to be fuzzing things I want to see how it actually works in the real\", \"start\": 8319.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah I know they're out there all very toy\", \"start\": 8399.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" evaluations yeah exactly the other thing is this seems too for one thing this wouldn't work for Black Box fuzzing because you need to insert these helper functions in the source code so Black Box fucking is out of the question with this\", \"start\": 8401.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" paper I don't know maybe you can instrument them in there may I don't know if you can't that's that's purely speculation is if you can instrument them you know find a concave get that code in there and then instrument the calls out from there I met there's the possibility you could do that but yeah I mean right now you do have to compile it in there\", \"start\": 8416.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" they're generally speaking you need a white box fuzzing approach and on top of that this requires quite a a bit of like human intervention right like you have to have the human looking at the state changes knowing when to wear to put in those functions they have to edit and recompile the source code every time they want to make a change this requires a lot of human effort and one of the big Boons of fuzzing is to try to move away from doing that you know you just let the fuzzer run while you do other stuff maybe you co dot it while you have the fuzzer running and you just kind of leave it sit there\", \"start\": 8434.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" and because you do need a crate the test cases the test Corpus or the fuzzer so that this requires even more effort on top of that well yeah I was going to say that though you can kind of relate to that I feel like this is more were hybrid fuzzing would come in rather than annotations using like the constraint solving to find those other paths that it's not not being able to hit I feel like I feel like there's maybe something to doing the annotations for what's of Interest maybe in another way like I think there's something to the idea there for sure\", \"start\": 8466.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah I like the idea I'm just I just question how much it's actually going to be like people are going to want to use it you know what I mean\", \"start\": 8503.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" all right I guess we'll see I kind of I question it to like I don't think it's going to be the next big thing I feel like that's kind of going towards more hybrid fuzzing\", \"start\": 8511.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah there was one quote though I really wanted to point out in the papers I thought it was kind of a cool quote it said computers are incredibly fast accurate and stupid humans are incredibly slow inaccurate but brilliant so that's why they're kind of marrying the idea of bringing the two together to try to find more\", \"start\": 8523.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" issues yes and no like I do think like the annotations and a person who actually takes the time to do that because that's a big thing when it comes to fuzzing like if you take the time to get the right the perfect Corpus for testing with it usually pays off a lot when you actually put the human in there to get some of that worked on versus just automation there's definitely work being done to try and automate a lot of them but the human intelligence aspect of it I think is still important at least right now like it still plays a big part\", \"start\": 8543.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I do like I do think whoever gets stuck in that job though of just writing the stuff and maintaining the father would probably suck like I don't know if I want that as a job it does seem kind of like dry work well it's\", \"start\": 8577.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" probably wouldn't just be you know a person who that's their only job I feel like that would just be like you do that as part of your initial setup ramping up on a project he do some of that to decide where you want the fuzzer to focus on set up some annotations or whatever and then otherwise it's more or less as normal it's you know part of that initial research phase and just getting up to speed on a new project\", \"start\": 8589.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" our last topic before shed its is another fuzzing paper it's a Pangolin which is incremental hybrid fuzzing with polyhedral path abstraction It's About Soul yeah so revisiting something we've talked about before hybrid fuzzing so just because it's been a little while since we talked about it hybrid fuzzing is basically the idea of combining live fuzzing with symbolic execution to try to get better State tracking and overall\", \"start\": 8613.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" coverage so not just that but can kolak execution is kind of important of concrete and symbolic execution I mean you did kind of say that with the live running but they take the live running they take kind of the register values again to functions they take on all that live data and then apply that into some contrary solving and using some symbolic execution on that concrete data that you've already gotten to help determine new seeds to determine new mutations and using that constraint solving to find ways into New\", \"start\": 8637.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Paths yeah so they note that existing hybrid father's can often get like super high overhead and lose efficiency we've covered some of the issues with hybrid buzzing before partially you know it can be hard to integrate with certain code bases because of you know the challenges that come with it but the problem that they point out is that the father is not able to keep track of the state when going deep into nested paths so you end up with the state not really being preserved when it could be useful so you get you end up with like these redundant recalculations of the state is how I read it and I think the part of the reason they do that is maybe to prevent State explosion on the like colic execution side of things but I'm not ya know\", \"start\": 8670.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" that that's pretty much exactly why is State explosions kind of the big issue yeah\", \"start\": 8714.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so that's where the incremental part comes in the heart of their tool is to try to fix that problem it does get pretty mathy because they talk about their own term which is in the the title polyhedral path abstraction but I think it's basically used to try to help out and guide the smt constraint solving and try to guide the mutation for code coverage but it is you know when you're getting into constraint solving and stuff like that you can see like there's these equations with symbols that most people probably don't even know exist\", \"start\": 8720.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean if you've done like a intro computer science when you should get two Street math or discrete mathematics in there so you should be familiar with the logic symbols that said it is great mathematics well I don't think he did a CS the curry either no I didn't I'm basically saying if you have a degree it should be familiar which isn't a good level to be using that said I mean this is I would have more academic conference this paper was accepted to secured the IEEE security and privacy all friends 2020\", \"start\": 8749.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah so we can't cover too much of how that actual path abstraction and stuff works but you know for those who are interested in the math behind that it is there the link will be in description but overall it seems to be trying to solve a problem that has been plaguing hybrid fuzzing so it seems to be trying to do something novel so even though we can't cover it too in depth we did at least want to mention it in the podcast yeah it's like at\", \"start\": 8784.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" least\", \"start\": 8813.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" on the\", \"start\": 8814.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" see I figured at least we could cover the gist of it here being that it is trying to kind of solve that keeping some history being able to kind of guide the mutation a bit through that history and guide something constraint solving like I said show myself something issues there it is a take on it unfortunately it was a little bit dense for us to kind of be able to give you guys the full details there but you know it's it's kind of Leading Edge of where some of that research is right now\", \"start\": 8814.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" but it's basically the idea of using past information to predict future information that's like the whole I think\", \"start\": 8843.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" this event I go with yeah yeah well that the path

paper figure out like how old it was and things like like that before I decide if we'd cover it or not and I came across this really cool GitHub which is literally just fuzzing paper and all this is a collection of recent fuzzing papers it's getting updated so I just wanted to kind of share that you know if you're interested in the fuzzing of research seems to have a good collection of them paying attention to what's coming out it's also just a good collection of fussing papers I also want to just put a question out to the community and just ask me aware of a similar repository for exploit
