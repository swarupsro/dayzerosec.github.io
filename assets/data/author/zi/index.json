Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. I'm Specter with Mia zi. This is the Easter edition, I guess so the podcast happy Easter to anyone who you know celebrates that for Easter weekend or for\", \"start\": 16.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" their next week for those thinking the Greek Orthodox calendar.

Okay, before we have some before we jump into topics, we do want to mention we have been getting transcripts tons. He's been working on that. So you'll find on our Blog the transcripts are up for the last episode and all the episodes going forward are going to have transcripts as well. They're not perfect. They are about\", \"start\": 43.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" their General are far from perfect. I will say that right now like since we since I do have it on screen you can see on here there for anybody. It's from song. Go is what Specter said very early on and when he introduced me it's so I'm Specter with me a zi.\", \"start\": 65.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So, you know, I've gotten your name is kind of weird way. I can't\", \"start\": 82.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" be. Yeah, I saw it did during my test runs actually get zi, correct when I gave it the hints for it, but regardless, I mean it's definitely not good, but there's enough there that you know, you can control laughs for something of interest if you want links links to the video on the side to get what we actually Said about something just trying to be there for those of you who don't really want to listen to All two hours, but maybe want to find a particular topic, you know, it's in there. It's probably not going to get any more accurate anytime soon. This is already using like Google speech to each attack stuff using their premium versions of it. So this is probably as good as it's going to get for a while until somebody actually wants to manually do it.\", \"start\": 86.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Wait, what's what I found kind of funny but the transcripts was for some reason. It seems Google speech seems to think me and anti are the same person. It will kind of put our statements together. Like it'll put stuff that anti says under my name.\", \"start\": 134.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, so at the end of statements actually so kind of happens on this one here this starts off that we as we covered on Facebook research when I was talking about last episode. Well Facebook research that we was Something. I Said Knock You So it does seem to some delay in there unless you just now mentioned like transcripts are there all the episodes going forward will have a link to the link to the transcript at the\", \"start\": 147.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" bottom. Yeah, so with that being said we'll jump into some topics. So we're going to kind of revisit something here a little while ago. We talked about Corp.com. There was a Krebs article on it back in February and how Microsoft was basically kind of being extorted in a way to try to buy it for 1.7\", \"start\": 177.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" and all that was episode 28. Yeah anybody who wants to look back and what we call him dead?\", \"start\": 197.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. So the reason for that is, you know, internal corporate networks will try to send like Scholes and data Corp.com due to defaults from all the way back in the 90s and the previous guy who the guy who owned it. Myk O'Connor he had it for 26 years and was trying to sell it for 1.7 million dollars and it seemed originally Microsoft wasn't going to buy it. They offered 20K for it like many years ago, but it didn't go through. Well, it seems Microsoft actually has now kind of bit the bullet and bought it. So, you know just kind of a follow-up to that story. We covered a little while ago. I think it's pretty cool.\", \"start\": 203.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I mean I still kind of think it feels very much like extortion at the same time me the fault here is like it is Microsoft's fall for choosing to use Corp.com as their default rather than you know, there are reserved in special use domain names dot invalid should always give you an NX domain return response Dolph Local Host is reserved. No RFC whatever for it should always return the loopback address da test. Like there are options here that could be used. That said maybe it wasn't at the time. I actually don't know when those rfc's came into play. But at least you know future updates. It should have been changed.\", \"start\": 239.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I mean, I think we're kind of an agreement that they shouldn't have had to but at the same time, you know, 1.7 million dollars kind of a drop in the bucket for Microsoft and I think it's it's still a good move by them, you know protect their customers and stuff like that.\", \"start\": 285.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So, yeah, it's a good move for them. But I just can't really stand behind the guy also try to sell it for\", \"start\": 298.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, I mean, yeah, it's kind of annoying on that part, but overall, you know, it worked out I think\", \"start\": 305.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, then like I said, it's a drop in the bucket. So I mean like I do think Microsoft should have bought it bought it earlier. Yeah, it's like we talked about this. I mean, it just feels very much like extortion on that, you know saying how he's going to sell it if Microsoft doesn't buy it I can get him trying to get rid of it, but Yeah, I mean we like I said, this was episode 28 we spent spent a fair chunk of time talking about it actually.\", \"start\": 315.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so you can go back and get the full conversation on that if you want a bit more insight into that but move on so usually when we cover the, you know, covid-19 stuff that's going on. It's usually in a negative light with things being canceled and stuff like that. But we're going to bring some positive news around it. And that's that hacker one is starting a little campaign where you can actually donate bug Bounty payouts or a split of them directly to the who covid-19 response fund.\", \"start\": 345.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so I didn't realize but this is actually kind of old news kind of new so I wasn't familiar with this aspect with hacker one. You can set collaborators when you have a bounty said who your collaborator what was and then you can like split the Bounty which is pretty cool. There's a particular user hack for good which was split here Bounty with a Charitable organization or with some charity. So this month it happens to be the who and their covid-19 response fund but that changes every month. So it's not necessarily a new feature. It's just that the hack for good this month is in particular on the who was response fund. Yeah.\", \"start\": 373.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" So like you were saying it works through their built-in collaborator system. You just add the user for for that and set the ratio you want to split to donate. And invite them to the report not all bounties support collaboration. But in those cases you can email them to set it up as well. I do have some questions around it though. I'm guessing this is all up to the researchers. And so ultimately they're the ones getting paid. But yes, I do with inviting a collaborator could vendors split researcher payouts forcefully, I wonder Like\", \"start\": 418.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I imagined some things through\", \"start\": 451.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so on so\", \"start\": 453.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so I don't think vendors could necessarily do a forcefully if there probably is a means that they could have some agreement with hack Wanda that said, I mean this also feel like when companies do this it always feels a little bit little bit cheap to me. So it's not that this is a bad thing in a sense, but at the same time hacker One is basically just making it easier for you to donate but you donate through them. So they get the tax\", \"start\": 455.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" write-off.\", \"start\": 484.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" That's a boy. That's and that's why companies do this like you're able to place the donation through them. It's same thing like supermarkets when they ask you to donate. They're donating that money. They get the tax write-off for you. Just you know, get to donate my conveniently. so, I mean imagine if hacker one were to decide, you know, if this was because this was important enough for them to put out the Blog post about who this months now, and actually I guess to be fair. I don't know if they put out this like every month of blog post with it. I don't recall seeing similar blog posts in the past stacker one is one of the blog's that I follow for this but assuming they don't they found this one to be a particular importance to mention this option to donate. Imagine if they were to just take off the top like a percent of their cock rather than saying like research Had to give out of their cup but hacker one which is going to donate a percent again, that would have a much greater impact. They're just saying like yeah, take your money. You can donate through US.\", \"start\": 486.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, ultimately the money is coming out of the researchers pocket not the vendors order hacker wants pocket. Yeah, they like you're saying they are getting the right off. So maybe maybe not as much of a positive light as I initially thought but that\", \"start\": 554.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" is not I mean it's so things like this. So to be clear like they do add a convenience factor to making the donation. They're definitely going to be people that wouldn't have donated otherwise, so it is getting my same thing with the supermarket system. Just having it so convenient and right there leads to more people donating like it does actually help with that. So it is a good thing. It's just you know, it always feels like a little bit of a scam to me when I see these\", \"start\": 566.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" things. Yeah, my bigger worry was that point I brought up earlier with like I'm what wondering if vendors could forcefully split the payouts. I honestly don't think that wouldn't happen. I think that would be like, I\", \"start\": 593.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" don't think there's any word. I mean, I don't know what their side looks like for that.\", \"start\": 606.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" But yeah, that's what kind of wondering like obviously we don't have insight into that because we don't have a hacker one Downey running. So I don't know what the vendor view of that looks like, but it was just something I was kind of thinking about fair enough if anybody is running like a half. Our one program. Feel free to let us know if you know, I'm off base but that but that was just something I kind of was thinking about\", \"start\": 609.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it. Well, I mean that functionality seems like something that would be more based on the researcher to say who their collaborator is not a vendor to say you collaborated with this person. Even if you didn't\", \"start\": 631.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the only reason like I think along those lines too, but I'm also thinking vendors might not want people just arbitrarily inviting collaborators in so I'm wondering if they might have At least some sort of influence on that but I don't know. It was just something, you know, it's not something I can take concretely one way or the other but it's been a while since we've had some releases and we have one right now and it's the red deck decompiler and it's hit version 4.0. So for those of you that don't know about rep tackett's decompiler based on llvm and it supports like a variety of architectures sports. X86 64 a rmp. Also\", \"start\": 642.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" 64 is one of Of the newer things\", \"start\": 682.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" for is one of the newer things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and also supports like other file formats like Pease elfs Mac OS so it supports like a lot of stuff but with 4.0 like you were just saying it's added even more support. They have support for Eric 64, they added support for Json output and they have a more modular build system. So\", \"start\": 686.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, so it's the build system that I'm kind of most excited about so I've used wrecked actually for quite a while was kind of my go-to. The compiler, you know when I didn't have access to Ida so it was a so early on it was basically a web interface you can upload a file and it'll do the D compilation. They had an API also that actually tied in there's an Ida plug-in you can use so when they open source this I think it was like I want to say a few years back with maybe 2017 2018. They open source that it was an exciting thing because now you know, it would become a lot more useful the reality though was it was an absolute pain to use. So the new build system seems like it should make that easier. They basically Specter already mentioned me a lot more modular. They swapped out or got rid of all the shell scripts for Python scripts. Hopefully will be an improvement. I haven't been able to try it yet, but I'm hoping that will kind of improve the usability of it. And I think the Json output is an interesting they've added, you know instead of just Being able to pull out. The actual D compilation they basically got all the tokens that does put set in Jason form. So if you want to process with something else, you don't need a reprocess the decompiled output. It's already done that for you. And I just kind of removing One Step, but it makes it a lot more usable for the\", \"start\": 706.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" machine. I will say it's really nice because I don't know if you'd want to argue with me on this point, but I'd say Jason is probably the best non-binary cereals serialization format. So I really like when things that have Jason support especially for something as useful as like\", \"start\": 803.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" when decompiler so, I mean, it's more than just the Json support here though. It's fact that's adjacent support of all the tokens that it generated a me. I think that's kind of the key thing. They're having That was tokens already having a tokenized just because otherwise, you know for just outputs found you do expect a decompiler to Output source code. You do expect it to Output that not Jason. So the fact that you don't have to do that step. You just you get more accuracy out of fact, I think that's kind of a net positive for if you want integrate this as just a step in a further further workflow. They've made that a lot easier to\", \"start\": 821.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" do. Yeah, basically they make it they made it so you cut you can still skip the step of parsing like Friday the lexical parser yourself it basically does that part for you, which is that really awesome because doing lexical parsing is like it is quite complex the other part that's pretty cool that they added as they actually have a library for now to they have like an official library for it. So and I think it has like bindings for a lot of the popular languages like, you know rust see golang so it's got a I think it's got a lot of those bindings if I remember right from when I looked at the GitHub for it, I'd say the library is probably the coolest part. I did want to ask a question though because you were saying you've used red deck a lot. I haven't really used it. How does it compare in like how accurate it is compared to like x-rays or sleigh for example,\", \"start\": 864.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" so that's I haven't done really a really good comparison there. So I was using it to one of the reasons I was using is because it's poor mips, which I didn't. Or actually I'm not even sure if Ida does well.

It's just far too expensive for most people so, you know this got some pipe people were thinking maybe we'll get I to with a decompiler for one architecture for a reduced price or something like that and it ended up being a disappointment.

I mean I saw this on Reddit, so it's going to Involved there, but you know the thing is I don't care. What I realized is. I don't think Ida has ever really had the Goodwill of the community. Ida has always been something as far as I've noticed. It's kind of just been something you begrudgingly have to use because it was the best thing available but nobody really liked x-rays as a company. Nobody really like the fact they were overcharging for it. And I mean as far as I can tell everybody's felt like they've been overcharging for this they've had the market Eminence and they've done nothing with it which is kind of the other thing. I mean, there isn't a law that you can kind of push with Ida that says our that shows how Ida has really innovated. I think at best you can pull out, you know, the wind graph the whole graphic system. I'm not sure this was before my time. I know the wind graph itself. Amen somewhere like the four dot something era so like early 2000 And I don't know if they were the first to do the graphing view or not.

Do they have big institutional clients might explain why they don't care about individual customers. And yeah, that's kind of the big thing is the professionals are using this professionals use either.

Maybe it won't or fix it yourself. Yeah, I mean you can do that. But so that is a big thing for Ida. They do have the market dominance. But what else can I get? NG is I don't feel like they've really innovate. They haven't really taken any good steps with that to be fair to them. They have had kind of that constant incremental upgrades. So I actually did go and look through the change long just to see if maybe I was missing something and people are definitely welcome to correct me on this. But as I was just kind of stepping through kind of the major releases and looking at the release information. There wasn't a ton the like, you know 6.0 with a big thing was the new GUI was using QT. Like our sorry, I think that might been 6.0. I pull it off. Yeah 6.1 though. It was like Android support utf-8 support 6.2. They had to GUI installer. If things like that, like, you know, especially jumping back on 6.1 with the font stuff like or with the text parsing like okay that makes sense to do. It's just nothing really stood out at any point. It's really being all that Innovative in the last, you know, 10 years. Maybe I'm mistaken on something. Maybe I just missed it, you know got stuck in my ways only using the features I use and that's it. But on the other hand though, you've got kedra which again, I mean, I'm not sure why I really pulled us being really Innovative with them, but they do have a good compiler. They don't have the Debugger, but what I will point out is binary ninja in the same price point as Idaho has plenty more offerings. In terms of that feature. Yeah, but the big thing in terms of like Innovation is that Intermediate Language the BNI else which right now they have the to the low-level the mid-level soon enough. They've been teasing it on Twitter is they'll have the high level which is effectively there decompiler. But so, you know at least binge are you've\", \"start\": 1311.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" seen\", \"start\": 1456.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" something new coming up something that's actually trying to innovate a bit and the ILS I think are really great idea.

And one thing I will say about the ILS while you're pulling that up is what also makes them really good is they have strong built-in plugin support to so like you can make plugins that can interface with the IL like very easily that is one like big thing with Benja is the the plug-in API is extremely strong and consistent unlike Ida's as well. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's going to\", \"start\": 1475.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" show like, yeah the plug-in API and step its effectively a first-class citizen here with in binary integer. But yeah, I was just going to pull up like the low-level IL basically just rewriting your assembly instruction to some that just slightly more readable, you know breaks out the conditionals breaks out the flags that are used. Industry right side has a very simple like if tracks you greater than 0 XE and shows you like the ethanol so I could just some really simple rewriting of it. The mid-level one goes just a little bit. Little bit higher giving you variables giving you some of the function calls. Just some basic ideas that are but it's really useful when you're just scanning. The instructions to be able to look that and then on the other hand instead of having the decompiler the ILS at least, you know on the low level IL it's a very unlikely to be lying to you about what anything stealing where's compilers definitely make wrong assumption. So you can jump through these different levels and you know, once they have a decompiler something doesn't quite make sense you jump back. He look oh, you know in the medium level 1 you can see it's actually not creating this structure. You don't have to jump. All the way back to the assembly.

Like Ida does not offer any sort of il-2 use. I don't think he'd refers anything like that either unless maybe throw plug-in, but not that I'm aware of. So just in terms of like trying to innovate at least binary Ninja 'he is one they're cheaper to they are actually making some attempt to innovate with what they're doing. So I need at this price point. Yeah, go ahead. I was just gonna say at the price point the personal student version of this is like half the price of Idaho more support although on that note. It's not multi-threaded. I think do you have you have a personal license Specter? I have a personal yet. I don't know. So how has the performance been kind of?

I think they've added analysis caching to the personal version as well. So So, you know there is a bit of that. It's kind of like Dedra in a sense. There's a bit of a overhead on the initial analysis time. But once that's done, you know, the binary ninja database file is built and then it's like, you know when you open it in the future all that stuff's already done for you.

And I think that is you know, that kind of answers the question of why now like wire Ida kind of trying to Push for this I think it's safe to say Ghidorah as well as Vector 35 announcing that decompiler coming for Ben. Shh like you were talking about earlier could be spurring that on a little bit and I've also been noticing that people in the industry are starting to switch even people from these companies you were talking about earlier.

I'm seeing that shift of people moving away and it comes in a few different ways. Obviously, there's kind of newcomers to the field. Ida isn't getting recommended as strongly anymore. Just plain and simple like I mean I the Ida Book used to be this one of the standard recommendations for books in addition to like reverse saying the secrets of reverse engineering and stuff. You know, the I to book was just some that you'd also pick up why because you're going to be using Ida. Maybe it was just a given that has definitely changed in the last several years, you know, there's definitely been punished for people just aren't like it?s still kind of considered the best option but your sufficient with Deidre your sufficient with binary ninja other more affordable options and from that with newcomers to the field starting to use those other tools eventually, you know, they become professionals. They're not using God. Ida so over time I think we can see either becoming relegated those kind of like Pearl those people that have used it all the time and never really moved on but those are kind of keeping up. Yeah, I've noticed the same thing people are starting to move away. It's not in huge numbers. It's not like flocks of people are just suddenly not using Ida and even when they are it's usually like they still have a night out license, but they're personally like their daily driver is something else.

Anyway, yeah, but I mean, it's just I kind of realized that as a company think never really had that Goodwill.

Like I can applaud that like, you know, they're they're done with it off loading the application by just putting the source out and letting people do with it what they want.

I think we can move on to some exploits unless you have anything any final thoughts in sandbox on okay, so getting into some exploits. Our first one is from zi zi and it's a zi post about a command injection found in pain to own Tokyo from November 20 19. It was run one from Team flashback who is hitting the tp-link routers.

If\", \"start\": 2356.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" it was imagine. It's more likely towards that tp-link tether or some other consumer.

So one of these packet types that you were mentioning that they were reversing can trigger a the one mesh service which ends up parsing a Json payload. Load that you give to it which contains like credentials and stuff like that. So the MAC address for the slave device is one of them and that Mac address is copied to the stack and is then copied into a command buffer through sprintf, which gets passed to system though. You can kind of see their you know, they go into more detail about all this trucks involved and all the functions of passes through but basically what it ends up boiling down to is the MAC address gets copied into a buffer that's then passed to system or concatenated into a buffer that's\", \"start\": 2403.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so it's placed placed into it. So it's placed into some lieu of code actually which ends up being called by System. But otherwise, you hit the key point there. It sends an encrypted blob of data that uses static encryption key that that's where the Jason's contained within it talks about something that talks about like their custom checksum method not entirely relevant to here as you said what's relevant though is it sends that Json object that could see Crabs that slave underscore Mac puts it into a variable and then here pulling up the coat relevant code. They'll see the s printf that as the system command had has that lieu of for matched. Well has the format string for the Mac equals and then for the Mac will go call system on it. So it's kind of in the middle fed. And that does come into play with how they actually solve this. But so when I say solve this one of the problems that they came up with is this looks like it would be a really straightforward. Command injection. It's calling system. You control some of the data going in there straightforward. The problem is that they're limited to about 12 bytes at a time because you know the size of a Mack itself plus their actual Escape so you can escape this as long as it's not doing a validation on the Mac, which it's not you can escape that with just the quotient semicolon, which is effectively what they do. They do the single quote to get out of the luau. Bat her to get off the Lua code semicolon and then whatever their payload is and then they'll kind of recreate the string. Basically, they'll come the last single quote is so the extra characters that are appended don't invalidate the command itself or don't kind of cause any issues with that. So they get appended onto the end which is so coming back to this.

Yeah print er, sorry building up the file one character at a time that requires 11 bite still one character. And then they show how I try to do a character that gets interpreted by the shell.

You're combining exploits and games and finally, we have one after a little while and it's in Starcraft 1 Starcraft the one from 1998. Apparently, it was remastered and released in 2017. The bug is fairly old. It was originally patched and 1.13 in January of 2006, but it ended up resurfacing because in the remaster and 1.21 they introduce Andy. The emulator which basically reintroduced the bug and the reason it's called the EU debug is EU d stands for extended unit death and it was it was basically a parser bug in the map scripts that allowed relative read write and basically arbitrary right if you factor in where it's you know reading and writing to her sir bug or\", \"start\": 2816.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" just like the one value just wasn't validated so when it would access an array, so it was a death counter.

So I apologize if I keep some wrong terms of but essentially you had that it would use just that unit type wasn't getting validate. So check the player ID. But Unity, you could basically provide any value into this actor. I guess. It's also important to mention that part of this comes down to the maps kind of supporting some scripting so people can Had their own story or introduce new game modes, and that's where people are able to set up and some actions that happen in response to things like in response some of the deaths.

So, you know, it's one of those things you can see like a game exploit and those are those are decently common to try to pour it into cpf challenges just because it's kind of a a unique area.

We always cover but getting back into some, you know, more serious ones we have. Oh my Zetas H, which is a DOT end remote code execution and it's basically due to falsely trusting environment. Variables in the dot end plug in or not environment variables but environment files.

You don't have to remember to do that all the time yourself that said so our study and be like are just using Source the command source. Actually executes the file not just loads environment variables. So if you have a malicious one that has codon and not just environment variables. It'll execute code and will do that automatically.

It's not going to serve its purpose. It's technically there but it's not going to serve the purpose that was set out for so that's where I think you know, if they prompted just on the first use of it. And then trusted it after that.

I remember the last time I know it's been a little while but the last time I went on my back I noticed that too it is that Ice Age so good. That's a good point. Thanks for bringing that up. But yeah, you know kind of a kind of a short little write-up. It's not a overly complex. Issue, but it does exist. So one of them bring up what we'll get into semantic web Gateway. So there was a white paper on packet Storm from Cody 16 and it's a nicely laid out paper that has sections on some environment information bug information. I kind of like how it was laid out and it's part of a miniseries. He's doing called hunting 0 days, which is it's kind of like a journal of real-world 0 days that he's came across and how he found them and whatnot. It sounds like an interesting concept.

Well, that'd but at the\", \"start\": 3360.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" same time. I mean, you've got a web interface you don't expect them to have code execution, especially when we're talking about like this some that's going to be used by Like I believe that some that would be used more on like the Enterprise level and not something that's super consumer-focused. Hmm. So in that case like they're going to want to have more protection like it's still something we're untrusted people may not have full access but it still kind of\", \"start\": 3424.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" matters.

So very like the most straightforward. Word command injection, you can get basically we've got a lot of command injections on this show. I just realize if you know, it's that's like our vulnerability class of the week. But anyway, you know, you can basically just use that to get a shell issue fairly straightforward, but I think it's cool that the guys trying to give some insight into the process, you know saying about like, you know, this is why I did this, you know, we always like to show those out just because those\", \"start\": 3464.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" dead included the full\", \"start\": 3518.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" process.

So our last exploit we don't have too much information on it's a VMware security advisory. It's it's an improved disclosure and the VMware directory service. We don't have technical details, but there is a bit of weirdness around it because it has a cdss three score of ten and nine point eight on the cve which Very high for what your typical information disclosure would be.\", \"start\": 3561.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, so we might\", \"start\": 3586.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" usually isn't just a memory leak that can use to you know, well so that I don't\", \"start\": 3587.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" think this is in memory leak at all. I don't think it's that type of information disclosure. I think this is more likely disclosing some sort of token or even credentials that are used for communication between different services.

They're all rated High usually with information disclosure. It's just information. So it's just confidentiality. Maybe maybe medium may be high, but you won't be able to impact Integrity or availability of the service. So the fact that that's all being changed their makes me think. Some sort of authentication or authorization information information that could directly be used to modify everything else which they kind of mention. It's highly sensitive information which could be used to compromise the vcenter server or other services which are dependent upon the Ender for authentication. So, yeah, we don't have the details on it, but I figured I'd one called out because I'm sure some of you are. It's using VMware and also just because we it is a little bit weird to see an information disclosure with such a high\", \"start\": 3591.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" rating.

Yeah, I'm not too familiar with VMware and like how they roll out updates and stuff. So let that's it your point but you know, it could be something that somebody might be interested in doing we'll move into some research though. Our first one is on bypassing modern xss mitigations with code reuse attacks, which is kind of cool. I haven't really heard of code reviews being used in a web context. Apparently. It's been a while around for a while since 2017 according to the article which is something fairly recent. And\", \"start\": 3694.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I'm 2017 to still pretty recent one comes to research. I mean, yeah, it was actually kind of new to me. Also, I mean technically so you've already matched this isn't new but at the same time it's a little bit different from my usual approach when dealing with CSP. It's usually looking for some weakness in the CSP header itself that lets you, you know inject something like defines what object or how you're going to get your code in there. Just some weakness. that whereas this Dimension is kind of about code reuse the idea of finding gadgets and existing libraries and reusing those in your injection to get around like if you have a CSP policy, you know restricted to only sell for something you'd find some Gadget or how to find Gadgets in. In the libraries that are already being used and reusing those for yourself. Like it's an interesting attack or interesting method. Yeah.\", \"start\": 3724.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I liked how they had some examples. They have an example of like an HTML page that sets a HTML element with a get parameter and shows how like the see it the CSP could be bypass. Their first example is a little bit contrived but it's something like if the page has a calculator you can use the Expression in that to inject existing page content somewhere else. At that excess us.\", \"start\": 3784.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah, they do that. Obviously, they move right on from talking about that really simple case to using jQuery mobile. Yes, you include that library and you're able and the kind of they show a gadget from if you go to the 2017 paper, which they link they include kind of more information about some different gadgets and other\", \"start\": 3807.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" libraries. But if you look they also they have like some examples of like the gadgets the types of gadgets you could use to bypass CSP and web application firewalls and stuff like that. So they mention let me just go to it so I can\", \"start\": 3827.7}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" yeah, well search string manipulation Gadget element construction function creation JavaScript execution sync gadgets and gadgets and expression\", \"start\": 3845.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" parsers. Yeah, so, you know, they they gave that real-world. But I thought this was really cool because when you hear code reuse you always think binary and this kind of makes you rethink that that hey you could use that in the web context as well and it absolutely makes sense and it brings kind of that new way of thinking to web which I always thought. I've always found web a little bit boring because it always seems like okay copy and paste from a cheat sheet if it works. Okay, cool. If it doesn't move on to something else, that's how I've kind of seen web for a while. But this kind of challenge is that thinking this Is this is bringing some of that binary thought process into web which I thought was like really cool and and it was new to me as well. Like obviously, you know, 2017 is when it was introduced, but it was new to me and I think it you said earlier to is new to you as well.\", \"start\": 3854.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" So yeah, so I think it actually like 2017 was first paper on it. I think you can trace this back a little bit further. I couldn't give you dates on it. I think the paper actually gives credit to another source though also.

Yeah.\", \"start\": 3949.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" But yeah, it was definitely kind of like you get the concept like as soon as you say by passing modern excess mitigations with code reuse text.

I will touch on there as you were saying csb hasn't In much adoption, but where I think it's cool to is this can bypass more than just CSP you can use this to bypass web application firewalls.

I think that's a good idea. But with that we'll move on to Our next research topic. So our next one is practical data poisoning attacks against next item recommendation though. This paper proposes a system called Loki guessing, you know, the god of tricks and or Norse mythology. That's probably where they came up with the name because I couldn't find it doesn't seem to be an acronym and it's you know, the system is being proposed for doing data poisoning attacks against black box recommendation systems and what I mean by recommendation systems is you know, Shopping sites, for example where they recommend items to you based on reviews and purchase history and you know the example they go through with is Amazon basically and their system is going to use machine learning to train the attack agent and how they do that is by using a simulator to get around the restrictions you'd have with typical real-world recommendation systems. So they basically run a simulator with a data set. So the example they use is like the Amazon beauty product section. They take like a bunch. Those and and basically make a simulator for that recommendation system and then they try to poison that system which uses a history of like the users actions and stuff like that certain interests and make connections between them and the key paragraph that summarizes what they're doing for some reason I forgot to write down the page number. So I don't know if you could search this one I'm talking about it, but they say the intuition behind such a design is that if to recommend recommenders can both get similar recommendation results and it Given data set the adversarial samples generated for one of the recommended recommenders can be used to attack the other so to pull off this attack. They assumed the attacker can see the full history of all the users in the system. They assume they can inject a limited number of controlled users and that they're hitting a black box system and at the attacker can only receive minimal feedback. They can't see for example, when the Target Model is retrained for testing this they tested against like the Amazon Beauty. It's like I was talking about\", \"start\": 4072.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" before I do want to jump in and just mention I do feel like one of those things the access to the full activity user of all our sorry full activity history of all users in the recommendation list at is a high condition. That seems like a really high condition everything else seems like they're taking as like what can somebody outside do you know, the limited number of control users not knowing the details limited feedback that one just seems so out of place for everything else like not knowing the details.

It's a bit weird. But you know when they did their testing they ended up seeing that they could force a display rate of up to 0.5 at 15 activities per user and those are fairly decent results. I mean 50% is quite a lot if you're hitting something. Like Amazon, for example, so, you know, it's kind of interesting hitting like recommendation systems and using machine learning, you know, kind of using AI to attack Ai and a way I think that's kind of cool. But like you were saying that is a good point though that you know, that is a very high conditional consider is considering their whole methodology behind the paper as being able to hit Black Box system though. Yeah. That is that is a bit weird.\", \"start\": 4244.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Yeah. That's why I wasn't sure if maybe I was misunderstanding and they only I need like the full history of their controlled subjects or something like that.

I thought the paper was kind of interesting. So, you know, one of the bring up our next paper though, I think is far more interesting and it's on the defense side and it's about Hardware Trojan detection using controlled circuit aging so how they propose to do that is basically using transistor aging to try to detect Hardware back doors and Trojans. So this paper is pretty technical it gets into the hardware level, but essentially what they're proposing is that when the voltage of a Sir goes from high to low. It causes short-term Aging in that transistor and when this happens the current that goes through it is reduced which causes a switching delay which delays timings and causes timing errors in the integrated circuits. And what they do is use machine learning to try to learn the bit error patterns produced from a known clean. I see and then they do the same thing against a potentially malicious I see and compare the results.\", \"start\": 4298.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" Well, so I mean maybe I was just distracted for a moment. Mr. But one of the big things is With the Aging that they're using both the Aging result are some sir. Did you mention the Aging aspect?\", \"start\": 4356.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I mentioned the Aging aspect. I didn't go too far in depth with it. That's\", \"start\": 4372.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" okay. Well, I don't want to go too far in depth with that. I was just going to make mention of effectively they find a way to artificially aged the circuit and then they use also over overclocking to kind of result in some higher delays when doing that and then it's the difference that they're finding like the difference in those bit flips the difference in the errors that happen when there's a region versus when there's not a\", \"start\": 4375.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Trojan checking for side effects\", \"start\": 4402.2}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" based. Yeah, and I thought this is the interest paper not because I totally understood everything here. But because this is an issue that I've known really thought about obviously it exists it matters. It's not in an area that I deal with like I don't deal with hardware at all. John are you I'm really knowledgeable in and but it is an area that like it matters. It's not something I've thought about but it was still kind of interesting like, you know, this is what they're doing. And this is what they're thinking about in terms of trying to detect those Hardware implants those Trojans.\", \"start\": 4404.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I'm getting into some results when they tested their setup. They ended up testing against some Trojan circuits from trust Hub. So they provide like Trojan circuits for testing for Or like these kinds of projects and they tested against three circuits the basic RS 80 100 a AST 100 and the AST 1000 and when they tested they ended up finding that they had a 99% detection rate against those circuits. So it seems to be like really promising and how accurate it is. That being said they did only test against those three benchmarking circuits. So it is pretty limited. It would be cool to see it. It's results against other circuits, though. That's pretty difficult like getting your hands on like known Trojan circuits is probably not too easy to do so, I don't blame them for that. But you know just know that that test results that is a little bit limited. So you might want to take that 99 percent figure with a you know, grain of salt.\", \"start\": 4437.5}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" It's a long. Otherwise that was that 99% is a very good\", \"start\": 4495.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" result. Oh, yeah sure. It's a long paper. It goes pretty low-level. Like obviously you're dealing with Hardware stuff. But Hardware stuff is always fun to talk about because it's almost like dark magic in a way. A lot of people don't really understand the some of the implications that can happen at that level and using stuff like voltage and current and overclocking and stuff like that to detect these errors and bit flips. Like it's such a low level that like 99% of people do not think about and that's what kind of makes it cool. You know, what it highlights the fact that with Hardware even the most benign things can hold valuable information, which is why it's such an interesting research area. So, you know, definitely One of the bring that up. It's a cool. It's a very fun paper, but it is like it's not incredibly accessible. You can get that higher level view like we did but unless you're like familiar with hardware and the math and some of the you know science at that lower level. You might struggle getting some of the more intricate details of it. Just you know, just as a fair warning I guess. Did you have any final thoughts on that paper though?\", \"start\": 4498.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" See? No, I mean I didn't even try to get the deeper understanding of it to be honest for all my took this as you know, it's interesting area. I haven't seen much on this got the high level understanding of what's going on, but I didn't even try to dig too deep into it.\", \"start\": 4564.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so we'll move on to our final topic and it's aptly named a final security bug. Oh you're bringing up duct tape though.\", \"start\": 4580.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" I've brought that up. Because you accidentally brought this paper up when you switch topics. Don't worry about it.\", \"start\": 4591.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Oh fair enough. So it describes a gang Google tanks Ed to five five one nine Java implementation,\", \"start\": 4597.0}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" which is all those three really private Keys really important to mention that this did not make it into the release version of tank, which is their kind of easy to use crypto Library significant bug did not make it into an actual thing. So like no empath It was actually found like in 2017 and patch in 2017. Yeah, I just this is the first time it's being written up. I believe he's presenting about this actually at some conference is that Thomas come up on my I-Car feed the cryptography feed. So I think there's some crypto conference at this will be presented at\", \"start\": 4604.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if the conference happens, you know, it's very close good to see it canceled. Maybe yeah, but they describe they first described add to five five one nine, which I haven't really heard of but it's basically an Edwards curve digital signature algorithm which uses sha-256 and curve to five five one nine. That's where those stitches come from there. They praised it quite a bit. They say it was designed with excellent security engineer because iteration so\", \"start\": 4645.4}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well, so the guy writing this from Google ting Google tank is from Google. I feel like there might be some bias here that said I can't I can't really say that they're not yeah that said like I Googled definitely hires good. People so I'm gonna assume it's true. Like I I'm going to kind of pointing that out ingest the more than out of a sort of serious issue with anybody\", \"start\": 4672.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" involved. Yeah, so she was not a bug that's like, you know a design flaw in the algorithm. It's actually in the implementation and the issue is when they sign the message they pass the message the public key and the hash private key and these arguments should not be changed by the collie function. And this is signaled by using the final keyword. The problem is these parameters are raised and the contents of these Rays can be changed without raising errors, even though it's declared as final because they kind of misunderstood how final worked\", \"start\": 4696.9}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" well so it's more I actually even want to put the blame or towards Java on this one. So if you're a c programmer, you're familiar const Char star constant a character array pointer, but when you use that The array itself the contents of it you can't modify it that's the idea of using the constant. A Java doesn't have an equivalent to that Java has this final which if you're not intimately familiar with the Java you my you'd be forgiven for thinking it's you know, the same thing is constant, but it's not that Specter saying it ends up protecting it basically saying like you can only assign a value to this variable or this field wants So it assigns the pointer value basically for the array doesn't act protect the content of it just kind of that initial pointer assignment for and that's kind of how Java does it? So as he's mentioning in Malad which just does like a basic competent or like a modular arithmetic on it? that ends up it passes in the hash private key twice to that function which ends up modifying the message and all I hear you kind of get back to what you were saying\", \"start\": 4730.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah the issue is because the collie can modify the parameter and it ends up modifying the hash private key and the first 32 bytes of that key is published and that means if you get two messages signed with the same key you can compute the private key see by using an equation to eliminate the modifications that were done to the hatch private key so they have a I think page for they have some those equations that you could use obviously I'm not a I'm not a crypto person I'm not a math major so I don't fully understand these equations but the fact is you know you can end up calculating the differences it's cool paper it is a little bit it's pretty mathy like some of the previous papers we've\", \"start\": 4810.8}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" covered it is I mean the key thing though is just that Final aspect like the fact that the values are getting modified ends up reusing this modified value. So the first time through a calculates signature correctly the second time through that hash private key is actually saved its kind of cash and that's where that second time through because it got modified it ends up using a different value and then you kind of figure things out from there. So it does go into the math but really the key thing there that I thought was interest was just the fact the issue was this trust in final which is where I kind of I'm down on Jabba for not having something equal to the constant in like C++ and c.\", \"start\": 4854.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I think I'd agree with that. Yeah, I'd agree with that. It's cool. Right like it just shows like even if you're like a super smart person who's like really good with crypto with when you're getting into the implementation level. Even if it's done by experts in the field. It's still very easy to make very subtle mistakes and you know that ends up getting an attacker is We an oracle into your crypto. Yes. Yes, not something you ever want them to\", \"start\": 4895.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" have something that was mentioned here was even doing the standard test but using like all the standard test cases wouldn't have discovered this and didn't discover this because the standard test would just check like case the signature just running it once this is a signature result correctly.

Yeah, kind of lends Credence to that fact that especially when you're talking about crypto and a library that is from somebody like Google that a lot of people are going to use.

enable you make the most of the extra time you might find yourself with.</p>\n<p>These are generally solid resources that will also be entertaining and engaging to work through and a focus on beginner friendly resources.</p>\n<p>We've also put out a Youtube video discussing all of these points along with some side discussion about stuff like whether or not you should reference writeups when learning (while talking about Nightmare) and the benefit of learning out-dated material (during the Open Security Training discussion) so do give it a listen if you want more information about your reasoning behind these resources. Timestamps to where we discuss each resource can also be found in the youtube description.</p>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://opensecuritytraining.info\">Open Security Training</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Introduction to Software Exploits: This is my go-to recommendation for anyone getting started with exploit development. Even more so than Hacking: Art of Exploitation. Its a reasonably gentle introduction, it does assume you know some C and x86</li>\n<li>Introductory Intel x86: <em>Really</em> dry class, but its good if you can get through it. Covers the fundamentals you need to know, and not a lot of crap to dig through.</li>\n<li>Life of Binaries: Great course, can be a little rough depending on your background but its a good source of just getting some of the foundational knowledge and understanding the whole process.</li>\n<li>Exploits 2: Exploitation in the Windows Environment: Another good course, its pretty dated at this point but we discuss the merits of learning the history before diving into modern exploitation in the video during this section.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://portswigger.net/web-security\">Web Security Academy</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>From the authors of the Web Application Hackers Handbook, rather than updating the book they've produced an online lab envrionment they can keep up-to-date. Covers several web-related topics and provides labs for you to play around with the issues</li>\n<li>Solid resource, even if just to play around with an issue or two rather than working through everything.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.nand2tetris.org/\">Nand2tetris</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This is less about the exploit dev, and just good for getting that foundational, breadth of knowledge. Work through building a computer from NAND gates to building and running a Tetris clone. Its the type of wholeistic understanding that won't initially seem to matter but will eventually pay off when you need to start digging deep you'll have an understanding of the necessary concepts.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://pwnadventure.com/\">Pwn Adventure 3: Pwnie Island</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If you're into gaming hacking, this is a game that is meant to be hacked that you can run your own server for.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sourcery.pwnadventure.com/\">Pwn Adventure Sorcery</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This one is a CTF you can largely do in your browser and still gets into the binary level exploitation, it just provides the tools you need in the in-browser NES style video game. I've not finished it myself but I've enjoyed the time I have put into it.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://microcorruption.com/login\">Microcurruption Embedded Security CTF</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Another in-browser CTF, this one is a bit more educational and structured than Sorcery, better for beginners. Less graphical and more focused on teaching.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://guyinatuxedo.github.io/\">Nightmare Exploitation / Reverse Engineering Reference</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>This, imo is probably the main resource for those of you more seasoned, effectively its a bunch of CTF challenges organized into topics with writeups. A ton of content, broken up into the various issues being exploited, so if you want to learn about a particular technique, its a good reference to grab a challenge from, work through it and compare with the writeup. You have the benefit of knowing the type of issue going into it so you can focus on what matters.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/\">Exploit-Excercises (lains.space mirror)</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>There are several servers here you can download and run in a VM locally to attack. Unfortunately the original has gone down but there are a cople mirrors.</li>\n<li>Nebula Server: This is the beginner server, general application level issues, not getting into the binary level exploitation. Gives hints regarding what topic you might want to research and think about how to attack. I like to recommend this server to beginners to give it a try to see if they enjoy the puzzle solving and research aspects. Its a good taste of what vulnerability research is like.</li>\n<li>Protostar covers a lot of the same content that the Intro to Software Exploits from Open Security Training covers, as such I think its a good resource after you've done that course to work through Protostar, and then onto Fusion to learn more.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://ropemporium.com/\">ROP Emporium</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>One of the next steps after Protostar from Exploit Exercises is learning Return-Oriented-Programming, ROP Emporium is an excellent resource for that, pretty gentle introduction and gets you into 64bit exploitation which is a bit different from 32bit.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://0x0539.net/\">0x0539 Challenge Site</a></strong>\n<ul>\n<li>Really any challenge site could probably hold your attention for awhile. This is just a project Specter and I built so we are plugging it here, but you can get a ton more sites from <a

everyone. Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. You may notice we've picked up a fossil on our way to the podcast today anti is back with us. So I'm Specter with me as e and anti as well, which is nice to be able to say after a long while though. He is only with us for about 30 minutes or so. He's going to have to bail out and do some stuff. So, you know, we haven't for a little bit but not for the full episode but we've got quite a Content packed episode today in terms of topics. So yeah, let's just get right into the first one. So there was an article on Facebook about buying the Pegasus exploit So for anybody is from song go\", \"start\": 8.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if on Apple Insider about Facebook, yeah just clarify\", \"start\": 47.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, so obviously, I mean this this group NSO has been known to sell spyware in the past to nation-states and stuff like that. But the CEO of the NSO group basically said that Facebook asked to purchase the rights of capabilities. From Pegasus. So according to the CEO Facebook was interested in Pegasus because they had their own app called and overprotect Anova protect, which I think we covered before back when like know what the new we were comforted. We\", \"start\": 52.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" covered on Facebook research which was kind of like, so an oval protect was banned from the apps Apple App Store and like somewhere in 2019, so to this happened this evening. Event happened with Facebook reaching out to buy some functionality of Pegasus happen in 2017, 2019 and overprotect was banned sometime last year. I think it was during the summer. It was also removed from the Google Play store which then led into Facebook research, which was that bpn that they kind of targeted towards or apparently or allegedly targeted towards teens and they would pay them like 20 bucks a month or whatever. Actually they might have targeted like a Team plus teens not not like 13 to 18. I'm not sure of the details on that but it is slightly different in terms of what type of information it was tracking things like that.\", \"start\": 84.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, so, you know according to the CEO they had went to by the you know by capabilities of Pegasus and apparently it was because they were worried that their app was less effective on iOS compared to Android which makes sense because iOS is like a lot more locked down in terms of privacy barriers and stuff like that than Android typically Facebook of you know, they kind of contradict this they say they're saying statement is meant to distract people from the fact that Facebook is suing in a so which they started like happy. Go for exploiting vulnerabilities and WhatsApp, but what I found interesting was they didn't outright deny the lake allegation. They just kind of said that oh, this is just to distract you from the fact that we're suing them but like, you know, it's weird. They don't outright deny it.\", \"start\": 143.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, I mean, they probably it probably did happen. But the thing is it's unrelated to the fact that they're suing going to so group over the voice exploits and WhatsApp. Yeah, they're suing over one thing. It's kind of unreal a over the facto. Well Facebook also want to buy it is unrelated. So, I mean the fact that Facebook isn't denying get I mean,\", \"start\": 189.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean, it's hard to get Facebook the the benefit of the doubt after all the stuff they've been involved with\", \"start\": 214.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well, I don't think they need the benefit of the doubt. They very well could have tried to buy it. Yeah, I mean and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. I mean people are immediately going to the facto. Well Facebook's I just tried twist I think anti had some thoughts on this. That's why we had brought him on.\", \"start\": 220.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I mean, I guess I don't know. I mean I looked over the article and I thought you know, the two interesting parts were like the timeline, you know, like the 2017 when they first sounds like approach them to buy, you know, the specific stuff for a novel or only. However, you pronounce it protect. So I think you know what's kind of weird is, you know the timing I probably agree with Facebook and that they're probably Doing it just because they're being sued. So it's perfect, you know kind of cannon fodder but like I think the weird part is now that they're suing them like my weird Twitchy response is that maybe you know, if I had to guess the sounds like something that Facebook was investigating and probably heard about again the exploits that are available so on so forth and was like, well, how do we go and approach this group without seeming like we're investigating them, you know, so what better way than to go and kind of push for something that you're doing and go and say hey,\", \"start\": 238.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" We'd like to use this to see if\", \"start\": 292.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" we can further our capability. You know, some part of me just believes that it was like kind of a way to probably you know, still Leverage What they'd find from the NSO group, but also be able to fill those kind of like holes in their capabilities. Does that kind of make sense?\", \"start\": 293.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well and I kind of agree with you it does seem like you know, Facebook's a company that's already spending a lot of time trying to track you and trying to get information. Can you make yourself auntie? We're getting some background noise. So Facebook's already spending a lot of time trying to gather a lot of information. No doubt. They have a lot of very smart people trying to do. So so it does seem a little bit suspicious that they're coming to NSO group to try and track users. I like it just feels like this is something that Facebook should probably are probably does already know and that as you were saying there's probably another reason that led to them actually approaching anti so group and I think a very well could have been related to them trying to get like threat Intelligence on what and a so group was doing rather than it being relate to them actually wanting to utilize the techniques out of the malware.\", \"start\": 310.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So You think it's a less malicious in nature than it\", \"start\": 370.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" seems. I'm willing to give Facebook that benefit of the doubt in a sense. That I don't think Facebook was looking to just start spreading spyware. I mean, I think that that just doesn't at least to me it doesn't really fit with and I'm not saying like Facebook is this completely trustworthy company or anything? It's just as a legitimate company. It doesn't seem likely to me that they were looking to actually, you know, just start using spyware and to be clear. They do only asked to use parts of Pegasus. Not the entire thing.\", \"start\": 373.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean it's worth noting that they also are worth how many billions of dollars you know, and their whole business model is built on you no not spying on user but collecting data on their user. So I'd be surprised to feel like they need to go to a group like NSO group to figure out ways to do that. You know, it just seems a little silly not to say that it isn't something they could have done but you know the more we look at it the more it just seems like why would they even need to go that bar? It'd be a perfect guys though to be able to say. Hey. Eat it for you know, the Privacy aspect we can't get through some of these controls but it is totally possible to to fare as well that they maybe didn't have that capability.\", \"start\": 413.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I know but\", \"start\": 451.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I kind of feel like a lot of people are leaving Facebook with all the pr like, you know battles that they've had with over the past couple years of all the stuff they've tried to pull like with the VPN app, for example that we were talking about earlier. I mean, I think they are having a harder time now collecting the data that they used to be able to collect so it does seem possible that they would want to go that like extra step to try to get more data where they couldn't they can't get as much now as they could\", \"start\": 454.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" before. Yeah, but this kind of monster was in 2017, though. Like this wasn't like for. Yeah, but approach that. Now this\", \"start\": 481.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" is was still kind of like\", \"start\": 488.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Facebook had a lot of facts is because they still had their own overprotect on the app store which gave them a ton of access. It was in 2019 that Apple changed their terms that stopped allowing basically stopped along Facebook actually no information about like what apps are running and all that detailed information that they would have wanted to collect. So if this were more recent, but in 2017 I mean, they would have had a lot of this information just from the people already installing their application and I mean, could you imagine what would happen if it were found out that Facebook was legitimately just installing malware.\", \"start\": 490.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" They've already done.\", \"start\": 534.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It is in terms of the Outlook from pretty much everybody because if you find out oh Facebook's\", \"start\": 536.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" just you know, Facebook's\", \"start\": 543.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" collecting a lot of information you're using their application. There's a I want to say implied consent when you start using Facebook, obviously, there's a ton of websites that tend to include Facebook. Like there's a lot of tracking and information that they're able to get without that. But basically as a legitimate company, I'm not expecting Facebook to go about breaking the law. And actually jailbreak some random person devices which Pegasus does being given a link through methods mentioned writing the document I using paying cyst, you know results in the Target device being jailbroken and the mail were being loaded to Modern steel data. It's one thing for Facebook to be collecting information. It's a completely different thing for Facebooked actually do so in a criminal in a alright.\", \"start\": 545.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Manner, but I guess my question is if they were doing this for thread until like you're saying I mean, how does this really help them in any way? Like, what are they going to do with that?\", \"start\": 590.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It's being aware of exploits being used against them would be one case\", \"start\": 601.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I guess this was already known like\", \"start\": 606.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Pegasus was knowing not necessarily all the details in 2017. I'm glad assume that they Continue to update Pegasus. I can't imagine that they use the same exploits now that they use in 2017 or they'd be using the same exploits in 2017 that they were using in 2015 or 2016 or not me. This is something that NSO groups continuing to sell. I have to assume that part of this process includes, you know updates\", \"start\": 608.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but those Let's Plays don't affect Facebook. Like that's why I moved to sit up that we're\", \"start\": 639.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" gonna so group was using attacks on WhatsApp though, which does\", \"start\": 643.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" involve Okay. Yeah, that's true. It's good. Yeah fair enough. I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna say something. No, it's good. I think I was just about to see what he said basically is that you know, like wow, it doesn't directly go after them. Didn't they have capability to scrape, you know users information from at least WhatsApp and you know, they may not have told the public their capabilities right up the way so they may have had you know functionality to steal Facebook stuff and you know other products blowing into Facebook. So I mean, I just the simple part of it though is I find it funny weirdly enough that it ever agree with face. A book on the fact that you know, it's weird that they would sell me throw this out there when they knew years ago that it was such an issue. You know, I do find it weird. Also though that if Facebook was trying to you know, go and find more private information of their users, you know, it's like going to try and protect your house with security cameras are being like actually I'm going to go to the Colombian drug cartels and by AK-47s to protect myself that like, it's such a weird Step 2. It doesn't make sense.\", \"start\": 647.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I don't know so obviously I don't\", \"start\": 706.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" want Earth\", \"start\": 707.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" can threat intelligence. So perhaps you'll correct me on this but it feels like it would be kind of up their alley if say Facebook's internal threat team. It just finds out that an assault groups may be doing something against Facebook. Now, I'm actually going to walk back my prior statement. It wouldn't make a lot of sense if NSL group were actually like had exploits are earning Facebook that they would then sell those exploits the Facebook. So I'm going to walk back onto my statement on that. That odds are they weren't going for help. We're necessarily looking for that because if they were they would probably approach and a so group under the cover of some other.\", \"start\": 708.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Throat, sorry know what they could have. No, you think could have gone over it a billion ways. I mean the the idea of threat intelligence rights to to stop threats and like some companies like Facebook are probably a little fast and loose with it. So they come up with some koi idea of like a let's go and tell him it's just for this. I mean I if I had to guess the way they wanted it to pan out was that they were probably going to get in there first off. They may have taken the capabilities and may have very well done that to spy on users more and stuff like that, but I think it also could have one of those things that you know NSO group if they sign up Facebook as a client. It's kind of awkward to them be offering functionality to steal your clients crap. Like, you know, you can't you can't be like, oh well now our latest version of this Mauer that we've created steals Facebook user accounts or Whatsapp. Like it's probably a little more sketchy on that end. So they it could have been just a weird roundabout way to get them to stop targeting Facebook and it's you know other companies if you think about it\", \"start\": 749.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" could have been I mean the thing is Facebook does have a lot of money. Throw around to your so that that kind of just ties in with Azure say like being a little bit fast and loose on that and we'll just come up with some idea and give it a try. I don't know how much money actually goes towards thread until with Facebook but given kind of the size of Facebook. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if there's a pretty substantial amount there. But honestly, I made it on a whole idea. I do agree with you on today feels weird like this is the timing friend is So group releasing that information, obviously, it's released as part of the Court. Court documents so it's not like, you know NSL group just like did immediately could but I don't know to me looking at from the outside. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know the intimate details here. It does feel more or less unrelated only showing that maybe they had a client relationship with Facebook.\", \"start\": 805.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It seems like they just want to get a shot in the\", \"start\": 866.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" face. Yeah. Yeah, definitely.\", \"start\": 867.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, I mean obviously like a lot of the stuff. I've been talking about is speculation. We don't know like all the hard details. Maybe we will see more come out through that lawsuit like in the future. I don't know but yeah, it is like kind of a weird story. Maybe we'll find out more later. That being said, I think we can move on to some Zoomer stuff. So Zoom, is that some pretty bad PR over the last week and this is the first of many courses related to our Feast on zoom in this episode and part of the reason Zoom has gotten so much attention lately is do Self-isolation with you know current world events. It's being used a lot by companies and governments and lots of other places for meetings. So Zoom has had security incidents in the past. So, you know researchers have started looking at it more closely do it being used so much lately and these researchers discovered some issues and that's because Zoom seems to have some disingenuous claims related to crypto that are either not don't seem to be true at all or seem to be misleading\", \"start\": 870.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" disingenuous or possibly just misunderstanding like written by somebody that doesn't understand that spot like Mark marketing may be doing a lot of fat and and I come at that just because they talk about some one of the things brought up in this is end-to-end encryption Zoom claims are has claims about their end-to-end encryption and like immediately following those claims. Zoom ends up talking about like TLS being used which TLS is definitely crypto, but it generally speaking like anti end is going to be a par from your standard TLS. I'm trying to find the picture. I'm thinking of in the document. But\", \"start\": 934.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I think the other issue is only the key exchange happens over TLS. I don't even think the the actual packet exchange happens over TLS. My am I wrong on that or\", \"start\": 983.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I'd have to look into it. But I have to imagine that if the kazoom does have a web interface, so it's going to have to be over http.\", \"start\": 993.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So here's the here's the like diagram I was looking at so they have observing a test Zoom call. I don't know if it's scroll down for you, but they have like get ski over TLs, but then the meeting it says it's encrypted with AES over UDP, but\", \"start\": 1002.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" like, okay, so that's that's a separate\", \"start\": 1018.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" from it. Yes key is not like end-to-end encryption.\", \"start\": 1020.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, like their whole end-to-end encryption is definitely wrong but seems like it's just somebody that doesn't understand what intend encryption actually is. And that could be intentionally misleading or could not other things that are mentioned in here are the they're using AES 256 in reality. It looks like they're using AES 128 and they're using ECB mode. If you're not familiar with the ECB mode actually they have the classic picture in this article classic picture is based with ECB mode. It takes a key and basically just applies. Is it to the block so a s is a cipher or block Cipher? Sorry, it's going to say Cipher block, but it's a block Cipher. So what happens is it splits up whatever your messages whatever you want encoded it gets split up into equal sized blocks and then the key wouldn't you could apply the key in several different ways. You could for example apply the key to the first block and then apply the second block to the following block and kind of chain them along ECB mode basically takes the key. Applies it to the block as so there's no connection between any of the following blocks? So what ends up happening is you end up with these pad if you have patterns in your data is two blocks are the same the resulting ciphertext will be the same. So that's only really an issue if you have data that's going to be repeating. So the classic example is this very much like uncompressed bitmap of the tux penguin. And you'll notice even when it's encrypted if you're able to see our video that you can kind of make out the outline of top so you can see kind of the original image or parts of the original image, even though it's technically encrypted. So that's why ECB mode is a problem. But the reality is when we were talking about audio odds are you're not having a lot of that sort of completely repeating blocks, you know, people are going to speak definitely the audio data is going to be continually changing. So there are things that could be Pulled out you can get information such as Cadence of packets kind of decadence of what's being spoken. There are definitely things that you can leak because of ECB mode but the risk isn't huge in a lot of cases with these female. Again, the problem with ECB is less ACB and more the fact that if you're using it odds are ECB is not the most significant problem in your crypto.\", \"start\": 1024.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It's a code smell Birds the crypto\", \"start\": 1182.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" quibble. It's definitely an issue. It's generally an issue because we use it's the easiest block mode to use pretty much all the other options require some other settings usually like an initialization Vector that would just be like some starting value so that every every encrypted instant sins up starting different and so they'll always kind of be different even when data is the same. So you'll use an IV for that. They need some further data. Whereas doing ECB mode. You need a key and you need the data. It's kind of that classic what you think of crypto if you don't really understand how crypto works. It's like you think that's what you need the data. You need a key. So people who end up use that tend to be the type of people who don't really know the difference. They just know what they want. They want this crypto therefore they use the easiest thing\", \"start\": 1184.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" available. Yeah, so there was also another issue that they said they discovered in the waiting room feature, but they're not disclosing it yet because they want to wait until it's fixed because of the risk, it could pose to users but they said they are going to disclose it when it's been fixed and everything. So we may see that on like a future episode we can go a little bit more to the specific specifics of that issue. I think with the most worrying part of this article was was the Shady bindings where the keys were actually being sent through.\", \"start\": 1238.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" He\", \"start\": 1270.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" servers even when none of meeting participants nor the company hosting the meeting were based in China. So they give an example of a test between a user from the US and from Canada and the key ended up making its way through to one of the participants through Beijing server. And what makes this really suspect is trying to can make it so that Zoom is legally obligated to disclose those keys to Chinese authorities. So I which\", \"start\": 1270.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is the beauty about when you hear the key going through there and we know it's not I intend encrypted and to be fair I am going to mention so I've used Zoom a fair bet well prior to this. I never realized I didn't even realize they made the claim of being anti and encrypted. Basically, they can't be anti and encrypted and I will mention that out. Right like they can't do EET simply because you can call into it. Like literally call it was so because of that. There's no way you could do end-to-end encryption Zoom needs to be able to decrypt act in order to let people call\", \"start\": 1296.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" in. Yeah, but considering Zoom is being used by governments and stuff like that. You know, the fact that those keys are being routed through Chinese servers when nobody's in those meetings in China is like I think it's probably the most worrisome part of the article.\", \"start\": 1333.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. It does seem a little bit just like a poor routing Choice rather than necessarily A designed to go through China that said it's absolutely sketchy. I mean it could there could be a benign reason and apparently Zoom has updated this such that it no longer.\", \"start\": 1348.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" What do you\", \"start\": 1365.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" got to but\", \"start\": 1366.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" is there no way they could like? I don't know do a few more test cases just to show like is only one time and then they showed like okay, it's going through China or you know,\", \"start\": 1368.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's the thing. I think they had to make multiple attempts until one actually went through trying to it wasn't every key going through China. They don't make their claim. Isn't that hard?\", \"start\": 1377.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Okay. That's all I'm saying is like, you know, if it was every single key than a big. Wow. That's\", \"start\": 1386.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" oh I'd be way more concerned about it. Then goes every\", \"start\": 1390.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" to like, oops did we And every key to ourselves damn it, we do that every time like, you know that I would have been like, all right.\", \"start\": 1393.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well, so it seems like all the keys originated from Zoom. So it's not even sending it to themselves because they generate the key.\", \"start\": 1401.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. So I mean, I feel like the most creepy part. I mean if anyone wants a good chuckle to themselves the thread until twittersphere has fought itself over and over again the past couple weeks about like if these things are truly bad or if it's a bunch of people just being a holes, you know,\", \"start\": 1407.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" because there's absolutely Cloud chasing way.

I do feel bad that while I don't trust Zoom my company even pushed out that we all had to uninstall it and we migrated something else, you know, it's kind of fascinating to see people pile on it. But, you know at the end of the day like what other things can you use at this point that has any consistency?

Okay, you can take that to the bank. Please. Don't kill me how much money get paid. But anyway, I'm gonna do a last-minute topics which are just because you do have to go here in a few minutes. I wanted to bring up the Mozilla advisory. So there's not too much to talk about here because the technical details are actually locked off, but there were there were some security vulnerabilities that were About Firefox one was a use after free through race condition and the NS stock shell the destructor and the other one was another race condition yielding use after free when handling a readable stream. So, you know, these are obviously they're both Firefox issues. We don't have the technical details and I think those bug references are probably going to be locked off forever. I don't think Mozilla ever opens them up to the public. But what made this notable was they noted that the targeted attacks. There's targeted attacks in the Old that are abusing these vulnerabilities and I think I thought that was interesting to see on Firefox because typically when you see that notice on browsers, it's Safari or Chrome because those are the default browsers on mobile operating systems. So I think it's interesting to see targeted attacks hitting Firefox where Firefox doesn't necessarily have the greatest market share when you're talking about browsers. So I was wondering anti do you think this could possibly be targeted the tax on Tor users? Because I know Tory uses Firefox under the hood right\", \"start\": 1678.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yes it does Tor Browser does technically you create you can use other browsers\", \"start\": 1781.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yes by default the Tor Browser that everyone gets is using Firefox has its base right now are so you're asking specifically if it's likely that is towards towards users or just in general targeting people yeah I was just wondering if like you think that these attacks that are using these vulnerabilities could be going after like Tor users it's like you know slow let's say journalist potentially using a tour for anonymity or something like that heylia dude are you kidding me I mean now I can't say Let me clarify first and foremost I can't 100% say right now that that's happening because I haven't no one obviously if they're being very hush-hush about it this happens every time with some of those well there's a campaign out there like what does that mean who is it you know so I don't know a hundred percent what that means in terms of this the specific one but you know it would be silly and my eyes for any nation state especially some of the more One's targeting various individuals right within the dark web who use Tor Browser and stuff like that. It would be almost nonsensical for them not to leverage that right now assuming that that's what this lens its capability towards right targeting users and exploiting them which it sounds like it does. You know, if you look at most of at least from my understanding the targeting of Tor users a lot of the exploits haven't even been sophisticated or relatively new right? It's always been people using outdated browsers and should I don't think for the most most part you're going to see like a lot of exploits getting dropped on Tor users that are relatively new may be attacking the service itself. But for this specifically to answer question. Yeah. I mean if it's something that targets to our Firefox, which is what's or browser is based off of I would be surprised if they decided no unless they've got so many exploits available. But even then again, it's just something to add to your Arsenal, you know, so I 100% it would be an easy just addition to anything that's assuming they can get the information out there.

I mean we can't know for sure who was being targeted with it. I think it's a reasonable to say that the Tor Browser is one of the juicier Target. If you are writing the eau de using it in the wild that said the Firefox users can also be generally are going to be a little bit more technically oriented.

I'll probably jump out now but yeah, I mean summarize yet, you'll see if it doesn't get released. I don't think you'll use seeing used against a lot of average users because most botnet owners and people, you know, targeting regular people often need the actual POC code itself, so Yeah, no, we know in the targeted.

Thanks. Y'all have a good one. All right, so we'll jump into the bug Bounty platforms topic. So we have a topic by CSO and it's basically saying bug Bounty platforms by researcher silence violate labor laws critics say so, you know one topic we've talked about a lot on this show is bug bounties and You're not disclosure should be allowed and generally I think we agree. It's reasonable to some degree. The vendors have the final say on what a report goes public or if it does at all after it's been reported through Bounty program. Well, it seems that's being challenged. So your\", \"start\": 1987.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I at least want to say I think and I want to be really clear Ideal World full transparency. Everyone has bounties Look at that for a sec you could have night in. Yeah. So in an Ideal World will have full transparency all vulnerability reports become made public and everybody has bounties that's kind of your ideal case, I believe but we don't we get there step by step. We're not at that point yet, obviously, and actually I will I will step that back a little bit maybe not every company has bounties. I do believe bounties or some that should be introduced once the Once your security is fairly mature, you don't want to just have somebody. Oh, I just wrote this over the weekend. Well, hey, here's you know a hundred bucks for every bug you find and like, you know, put them out of\", \"start\": 2022.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" business. Yeah, you end up throwing money away.\", \"start\": 2071.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, like it's part of the maturity process to end up adding a bounty end. But Ideal World is generally speaking one sermon speaking about mature companies and companies that have a mature security process vulnerability should be disclosed. Publicly and and and they should have a bounty and I do also want to adjust as we get started on this draw really quick distinction because we're going to be talking about like nda's and agreements before you're even able to start testing itself that there is there's two kind of types of applications. You could be testing. This is a very wide Description but either an application that is hosted by somebody else. So if you're testing Facebook, you're not self-hosting Facebook or PayPal or something like that. You're not self-hosting those things. Somebody else is hosting its so in order for you to test you need their permission. Otherwise, it's unauthorized access and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the u.s. Is insanely vague when it comes to actually defining what unauthorized access is Although I think actually some of that may have changed recently. There was something about the terms of service not being is binding. Although I know there have been cases where terms of service and basically, well you violate the terms of service. Therefore all your access was unauthorized than it was Computer Fraud and Abuse self sudden, I think something about that changed. I don't follow a lot of the legal cases. So maybe I'm wrong, but generally speaking. I'm just going to be speaking under that assumption unauthorized access. If you don't have permission to be hitting that hopes that application that's somebody else Helsing the other type of application. You can be testing our self hosted things things that you could run locally if you want to test Android if you want to like work on your Android phone you could do that or Linux your operating system running a web server locally. You can test all that kind of self hosted you can do whatever you want on those service. It doesn't matter what the ndaa As you're breaking no laws by doing that local testing. Well, if you violate their dmca can come in there are some things but generally speaking you're not violating any laws by doing that sort of local testing. I just wanted to bring that up because when we talk about bounties most of them are these hosted applications, some of them are self hosted and I think a lot of what's going to come up really has to do more with the hosted applications, which is most bounties that you see on The program like cat or one or bug crowd.\", \"start\": 2074.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Okay, so bring up the point you were saying earlier with like in an Ideal World. Everyone would have bounties. It actually seems like some researchers are challenging that a little bit they're pushing for vulnerability Discovery programs instead of bug bounties. I have if there's a little bit of like a different term like set of rules with that. It's a bit more like you can't Outsource it. I think are you\", \"start\": 2235.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" sure about that? Because I thought it was vulnerability disclosure. Programs not discovery, which is a different part of the process because they talk on V DP which is vulnerability disclosure\", \"start\": 2258.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" policy. Sorry. That's what I meant VDP.\", \"start\": 2269.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. So VDP that was slightly different VDP is and this article actually I think just makes a mistake kind of conflating VP with coordinated disclosure if EDP is just the disclosure program. So having like a Security Act email address or the secure. T dot txt file having a way for researchers to reach out and disclose vulnerabilities to you in a safe way in a way that they're not going to be charged with a crime for doing so that's what the VDP is. Okay. So that's a little bit different bounties separate from that. And yes, every company not just mature companies should have a VDP. Some people do have questions about the bounties will be getting to that later on in this topic. But I guess when we just start off going through in order here, one of the first things that comes off our first issues really raised comes down to the Safe Harbor and NDA. So like I just mentioned reporting a vulnerability you kind of end up in a case where if you report the issue they can then say well that was unauthorized access. We're going to charge you, you know your going to be prosecuted for that crime, even though you're trying to do the right thing by reporting vulnerability and this is definitely happened. And I think I've talked about my views on disclosure of ought over the last few episodes and I think a big part of kind of my weariness and like always deferring to what the company wants comes down to kind of having had my start and the days where people definitely were being resident. They weren't operating in the most Adamant manner, you know testing for SQL injection on every website you visit type thing. But you know, they'd report that and then get charged with the crime for it there. They're testing definitely wasn't. Wasn't in line with what would be considered responsible and I'll be fair to admit that but at the time basically there was no option. Now. You can run vm's you can do with law without needing to actually test on somebody running a real server. There's a lot you can do but you know still for teenagers in the late 90s early 2000s. It was definitely a lot harder to do that and at that time people would test and report an end up charged with I'm so I think that's kind of where some of my views on just letting the company do whatever comes in. So now jumping back to the safe harbor Safe Harbor is just that you won't be charged with the crime. What's happening with bugcrowd hacker one with private bounties is that you'll basically be told sign this NDA you'll be added to the private Bounty and then you can report your vulnerability. So you can talk about the show before you can disclose or they basically set a gag order on anywhere. You can't talk about here issue if you want to disclose it to them. Or if you want to do the responsible thing and\", \"start\": 2272.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah, basically trying to punish people for for going the right way. Well, so\", \"start\": 2465.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here's the other thing though and it is worth noting like most vulnerability assessment have an NDA, you know real world assessments when you're working for a company that's been hired to do an assessment. You have an NDA. I can't, you know talk to you about all the vulnerabilities I found in whatever clients I've had. Now there's an NDA there like that is a pretty standard process. It's just like you don't want to effectively humiliate your client so it is different with these. Well, so again that kind of comes down. I definitely there are cases where I don't know. I'm just trying to think here if I can come up with a good example where perhaps it would be a good idea not to publicly disclose or at least not and when we talk about it publicly disclosed generally where I'm assuming I'm assuming things have been patched and have had people who've had time to update. And in that case like know as I did say earlier, actually, I do think all vulnerability should eventually become public. So there's no case where they shouldn't at the same time when a company is hiring, you know, a pen testing firm. Any funding is going to be damaging to their reputation. No matter what so I can understand the company not wanting to expose that and I want to be yeah, we had these vulnerabilities and thus they're hiring researchers do it at the same time. I mean, yeah, I would like to see those public but I get why company wouldn't want that out there, especially if it's pre-release products. I know for me A lot of times we'd be brought on kind of during the standard release cycle. So it's like we are about to release this get the security testing on it just before it actually gets released. So then those vulnerabilities never even would've made it to the public at\", \"start\": 2469.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" all,\", \"start\": 2592.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" and I think I can at least Understand if it's part of your kind of secure development lifecycle. not publicly disclosing those\", \"start\": 2594.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" vulnerabilities I think part of the reason that like the non-disclosure like security researchers taken issue with the NDA is they'll basically use it on researchers who submit issues so that they can't talk about the issue publicly. And like you said, they can't damage the company's reputation\", \"start\": 2602.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" was so that's a little bit different and external researcher versus being the hired by the company to do\", \"start\": 2619.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" okay now is make certain point like talking about external\", \"start\": 2626.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" researchers. This is I was making the point that most assessments. So do happen under an NDA. Most okay assessments aren't bad. Well, I don't actually know the numbers to compare like literally like our most requests generated by bounty hunters or by hired can hire Consultants or whatever but generally speaking there are a lot of Assessments that do happen under an NDA that are just they're hired to do it. It's not under some sort of public bug Bounty that said there's a trade-off when it comes to public bug bounties. And I'm going to and I'm going to say like I don't agree with having an NDA to report a vulnerability. In general, I mean, I think more Andy like a timed NDA where it's like you can talk about this until it's patch or until we reject the issue or something. I think that's fair. Like, you know, you can't report this about our can't report this bug to us and then just start talking about it immediately give them time to fix it, you know, basically Force coordinated disclosure. What do you disagree with that or kind of\", \"start\": 2628.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" agree? I think that's fair. But I think what the researchers are arguing is they're basically saying, you know, once your important issue to them, you can never talk about it and what\", \"start\": 2697.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, and I wouldn't agree with that I'm saying like as long as there is a timeline for\", \"start\": 2707.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" disclosure. Oh, yeah, exactly. But that's what they're arguing is that you know, they trust\", \"start\": 2711.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" so oh, yeah, they're arguing lurpak. You can't what kind of\", \"start\": 2716.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Harkens back to is issues that were reported last year by Jonathan list Sookie. I hope I'm saying that right and it actually relates a little bit. It to zoom it was issues found in the zoom client. So we tried contacting them to get the bugs fixed and he offered them, you know, the standard 90-day disclosure deadline to ship a patch and then you know after that 90-day deadline he would disclose it to the public and they kind of they didn't want that. They wanted him to accept the Bounty and sign an NDA that would have forbade him from you know, publicly disclosed in the issue and I think the reason that researchers are wary of that is they're worried that they're basically Going to by The Silence of the researcher and they're not going to fix the issue or they're not going to take the issue seriously and fix it like way down. The line after could have been abused by, you know, malicious actors during that time period so I think that's why there's like more of a stigma around bug bounties why some of these researchers is this like you're buying my silence and not actually fixing the\", \"start\": 2720.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" issue. Yeah, and I'm actually going to say like, this is something that I think hacker one is in a really good place to change. You know if they so I again get you get there and steps getting to that fool complete transparency all the time you get there and steps. So what I could see is like having a plant, you know, a company signs up with hacker one because hacker one does offer a lot of benefits to come near homes having the bug triage having some of that so they're not getting all the garbage report and then they get a little bit of tension if you offer a bit of money, there's and how One just makes it easy for the company's so hacker wants in a good place. So to also start pushing those companies towards a better model where their disclosures and hacker one doesn't do this, but I think something hacker one could do is a company signs out with them. Okay, you don't need to disclose anything in your first year with us. But in your second year, you know, you need to be disclosing, you know, all of your critical vulnerabilities. Or you know and in your second, or maybe maybe they'll go the other way like but having some sort of step-by-step process were over time. They're going to increase the amount of disclosure. They have and working them up towards that I think that's something hacker one could do they don't do it, but given the position that they're in they could easily leverage their position to walk to do something like that, which I think would push security forward in general.

Now one thing I did want to touch on is one of the more interesting points, I guess of the article and take keep this in mind like anybody listening like neither of us are lawyers. So this is going to be you know, if there's any lawyers listening they may be like these guys have no clue what they're talking about. But anyway, they talk about the legal implications of bug Bounties in California. And with the EU with GDP are now I think the the California one's kind of silly. It's basically Doing on minimum wage and I think the argument is just dumb. Yeah\", \"start\": 2900.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" with the so here's the thing and I just kind of feel like bug bounties. They kind of related to being like Uber driver or something like that that gig economy and Bug bounties are less like that and more like a contest the skill-based contest.

It's a contest and I think that makes a\", \"start\": 2932.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" difference. You're not an employee. You shouldn't be getting paid a minimum wage for bug hunting like they're kind of suggesting there. I think the more interesting one will though was the gdpr point and I think what they were trying to argue there was like users have the right to know if there's a potential breach due to issues that are found and that should therefore mean that those issues should always be publicly disclosed after their fixed so I was kind of curious on what your thoughts were on that.\", \"start\": 2962.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah.

Seeing actual client information you should be pulling down actual, you know credit card information or something like that that said that Specter was saying I'm not a lawyer perhaps with gdpr that doesn't matter and just if you have a vulnerability that could have been used to breach this data. That's all that's needed that said I would agree though with the statement that if a bounty hunter does pull out personally identifying information does full any sort of that information out.

So I think we can move into some exploits continuing our Zoom Feast into the exploit section of the show. We have one here related to UNC paths and how those links are rendered to be clickable which can allow people to steal ntlm hashes.

So in Zoom when you send such a link, it'll create our when you send such a yours UNC it'll turn that into a link you can just click and then windows will do its default thing try and open it. And it'll send your ntlm hash over to the Target server. That's the actually it's kind of an issue with Windows. Just sending your authentication by default. Although it is kind of a sane move to send. Credentials you can turn it off by default. I'd recommend doing that and then you just have to manually basically get it to send which I think would be a more sane default, but I kind of understand the history here.

I mean this was blown way out of proportion. That's that's kind of what I was going to find a way to say is the gist of this is don't click random links, especially not random links that are UNC paths. I was actually I was on a Discord. We're in the staff chat. They actually asked like do we want to you know, add everybody about this because it's such a huge issue. It's just like one they don't normally alert people about issues at all to Don't click links like this. Isn't that big of an issue? Don't get me wrong. And actually I will say like for Zoom doing it like zooms. You said a lot of business contexts where you're going to have these sorts of Link's flowing around. It makes sense to make them clickable. I would put this moron I think window should maybe do a more same default. By not sending them by default and just you know prompting forward or something. Like I would put more fault on Windows. Just having this is the default rather than on so making it a\", \"start\": 3325.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" link. When I saw this issue I pinned it as basically a glorified phishing attack while you could argue Zoom could try to mitigate the issue by not making UNC paths clickable.

Our next one is actually a zoom topic\", \"start\": 3585.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to actually to vulnerabilities in this one. Yeah, this is two things one is the local privilege escalation to root on I think both of these.

Basically, they just discovered and this was another one that I saw getting mentioned a lot witch. It's at least I'd argue about it one. It's more on zooms all it's more. It's more zooms fault and maybe a little bit more useful in terms of actually doing something with it. So the gist of the first one though local privilege escalation is that the zoom installer uses this lovely API authorized ex came with privileges. Basically just a way to execute with enhanced privileges are execute is roped. The API itself is documented as being insecure shouldn't be user. I believe it's even deprecated on OS X but it doesn't validate the binary. It doesn't make sure it's signed or anything like that if the binaries read-only are can't be modified. There is otherwise protected it's still kind of okay to use it. but but with that it doesn't validate so if somebody could change the binary. They're basically to give her a note Zoom. The binary of Ron's is basically a bash script run with route. So during installation that run with root file as a period of time where it isn't protected as the installer unpacks the package file into a temporary user writable location. So somebody could exploit that by waiting for that file to eventually exist and be created and replacing with their own content and Then the installer will eventually end up running with roped. Whatever they put into that she'll file. Yeah terms of go ahead.\", \"start\": 3608.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So I'm just going to say you are you were cutting out a bit for me there. So like I apologize if I re it reiterate over an issue or you already touched over but part of what makes these issues a little bit more impactful to is it was actually discovered that the Mac OS installer would perform the install without you ever even clicking install because it abused pre-installation scripts. So on its own that shady but, you know, not necessarily malicious and But how it also gets that route privileged on the script that you're talking about that could potentially be hijacked is it'll prompt the user for root privileges. If you're not in the admin group, it doesn't prompt for root privileges as itself. It says system needs your privilege to change. It's almost like intentionally misleading to make you think that the Mac operating system needs your permission not zoom itself. So there's some shady issues on top of it.

It's effectively dll injection own OS X OS X does provide a hardened runtime Library validation which prevents prevents you from loading either are only allows you to load Apple libraries or those that are signed by the same team ID as the application itself.

We have a zi zi blog post about a use after free in the VMware Workstation DHCP server, which was submitted to them by an anonymous researcher last month. So unlike some of the zi zi stuff we've covered in the past. This isn't like a working backwards from like a patched it for anything like that. This is an issue that was submitted to them. So the article first does a bit of a dive. Into how the DHCP release message Handler works and the gist of it for understanding the issue is it will end up copying the data from one leash structure to another so like source to a destination and it thusly structure contains various information like the client IP address the hardware address and a unique\", \"start\": 3953.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" identifier.

Yes what I was thinking\", \"start\": 4048.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" too. So you don't worry. They're not clear. They literally just say when those two messages like DHCP discover followed by the release messages repeatedly received this happens. It doesn't really go into why that happens, but eventually it does happen there. Well, yeah, I mean, I'd love to know but I guess if you're writing the exploit, it doesn't really matter. You just know if you smack you get this to happen, you know, you don't need to dig into it. So I get why it's not there.

You ID field didn't point to the same location before calling the free so very simple patch the article didn't go into detail of how to exploit this to perform the VM Escape.

It's almost certainly going to be exploitable.

So there were some pocs out the for this bug before But all of them were they were basically just denial-of-service pocs. Nothing forgetting code execution though. The advisory said the code execution was possible because they labeled it as an RC e so this post explores how they actually exploited it to get code execution and not just a Das. So first the detail the specifics of the bog or rather I should say bugs because there's multiple cascading integer overflows in this code. So for those who are watching we can bring up The code on the screen here and you can cause overflows on two different fields in here that can cause like propagate issues further down the line. One of them is on the offset field and the other one is on the original press segment size field and after these guys played with different combinations of overflows for these two Fields. They found the most promising combination was to use a reasonable offset value, but a very large original compressed segment size value and what would happen here is due to the integer. With the addition statement the allocation when it up being\", \"start\": 4537.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" smaller than yeah so Fields, I do want to interrupt you really quickly and just kind of mention what's going on with this. So you get the SMB packet that comes in and it contains the raw data and obviously it's most that most particles do it includes a header that header your actual data the raw data may be compressed. It may not be or maybe it is always compressed because this sorry this is Function in particular is dealing with stuff as always compressed. It's decompressing the data. So it'll take that raw data. It will allocate a new buffer and then it will take the compressed data. It'll decompress it into that buffer and then it will prepend the raw data any data that was in there. That wasn't compressed. So that's where the header offset is basically saying like all the data before this offset. That's just it's basically it's providing the offset into the data block to where the compressed data starts. So all the information before that offset just gets men copied right into the buffer to the start of the buffer and the compressed that is the compressed into the new buffer starting at that offset. So just to kind of explain something valleys there like the offset is how far into the data block the data that is compressed. That is the original compressed data size value or field is of course, the original compressed data size are segment size, which I think is self-explanatory. And obviously you can control both of those in the header. So deciding all the proof of Concepts just gave it, you know, 0x F of f so minus 1, which of course are like the biggest Value possible or minus one if it's signed effectively overflowing the integer causing a crash when I would try and access this memory eventually or try and write to memory there sir. You can go on though with your explanation.\", \"start\": 4619.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. So like you were saying the POC is a were out there were just a DOT because they used a very large value. We would write way out of bounds of the buffer, but they ended up, you know controlling it more because you do have quite a degree of control over that value and They found that they could actually smash the header that you were talking about of the packet on the Heap. And so they were originally going to try to trigger a use after free because there's a piece of code in the snippet that was on screen that would trigger a free on a certain condition and they were going to try to force that condition with memory corruption, but when they tried it they accidentally ended up finding a far better route to exploit this and they basically found that the decompressed function that gets called updates the final. Sighs value to the compressed buffer size. So the mem copy down below is hit and then they can actually control what buffer is used for that mem copy for the sore for the destination so they can basically get an arbitrary right through the mem copy. So, you know\", \"start\": 4746.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the answer so I do want to add in a little bit that they're a little bit I think you kind of skipped over. Okay, so when they have the user buffer, obviously there's that Target buffer that's been allocated. They kind of control the ultimate size of that as we've mentioned because they control you know, the size of the data. That's when we dealing so they know what the size is going to be. So what they're able to do is they control that in such a way that the It can be allocated in several different locations and they talked about this a little bit as I believe there is a pool forward and there's a look aside list for some it all comes down to the different sizes larger. So large applicate our sorry large allocations will just fail anything larger than 16 megabytes medium allocations larger than 1 Megabyte less than 16. We'll use this buffer pool and smaller ones less than Meg will use the look aside list the look aside list that they Implement here includes Med information in line. With the Heap data, so they show it on screen here you end up having the user buffer that gets returned every turns this object that includes a pointer to the actual user buffer and following that buffer at the end of the buffer is an allocation header structure that includes that is kind of the object that gets returned. So Avery turns that allocation header and that includes a pointer over to the user buffer rather than just returning that user buffer, so it's not Not it's not working quite like Matlock. If you're just expecting to return a block of memory returns an object that Sorry, I was distracted by the comment and chat, which I definitely want to deal with after I keep talking about this. But anyway, so the allocation header struck is where they get if I come back up here is where they get the user buffer. Address for so you control the decompressive data or sorry you control the raw data in the packet that's going to be copied to that location. And because the Overflow that you can get with the decompression, When it's decompressing the data you control what that pointer is pointing to. So you control the data that's going to write and you control because of overflowing that metadata in the heat in the heat that they create you control the address.

I think we can move on to exploiting parts are differentials and get lab so our next issues directly and get lab and it's from their file upload functionality it seems and it's kind of a cool attack because it's similar to the HTTP desync attacks.

So it's not like a user can Define any path of where that file is written to on the disk, you know, it's managed by Get lab work horse. So the work horse Takes that request upload the file and then it rewrites the request and passes it off to get lab rails with the proper path. Now. Normally it wouldn't be possible to control any of the put request from Workhorse to rails as that's all handled internally, but there's an issue due to the method override functionality.\", \"start\": 5250.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well, so I think should also mention here is that we're course is as it's a reverse proxy.

Yeah, that's kind of an important detail here where the desync happens is Workhorse has no knowledge of this method override whereas rails by default has this rack method override middleware that looks for underscore method as a parameter or X HTTP method override as a header, and we've talked about issues with method overrides before. Yep. We have it's definitely it's A common method for I mentioned with dealing with fire web application firewalls that might not be aware of it, you know kind of a similar deal here with the reverse proxy. It's not aware of that. So it seeing it seeing you know, probably a post request or something like that coming through like okay. I don't know how to handle this post request. So I'm not going to worry about it whereas as web servers like oh, hey, I got a pull request because it's get it gets overwritten so you can kind of Maybe start to see where this is going. We're now if you're able to override that request sending some that doesn't get Modified by Workhorse but is still treated as a put a request in the rails application. You might be able to get to start working with another file. Yeah any file. Well, not quite any file. So actually the rails application doesn't completely trust. Just what it gets it actually has a wife list of acceptable paths and it also had slash temp to that but they have a whitelist. So even with that they still kind of protect the endpoint a bit. They don't just trust Workhorse to give it exactly what it needs. Nonetheless. Basically you can still get it to work with basically any file that exists in slash temp or any other acceptable directory. So you would have to know some of those file names you can make some guesses. Is about what might end up in temp? But you would have to know that actually abuse this issue.

Like they just need to be passed through so it's not going to sign those requests presumably. It's only going to sign the ones that work horse goes ahead and actually modify. Its or that things that actually need a pastor War Horse which means on the rail side or somewhere there needs to be either a white list of routes that can be processed without a signature or all the functions need to check that signature like there needs to be some way for its know what methods are OK or not.

That's exactly what I'm thinking is eventually somebody's just going to mistakenly Miss some endpoint or something if they've implemented how and think maybe they've thought of something else that just then come to mind when I was reading that but my initial thought was that there need to be some list that gets maintained here now, perhaps they could sign it with Like in the signature like they can include some meta information that then allows it to know kind of the URL that it thinks Workhorse signed. So then that could be done at a universal layer where it's just looking like is the signature like does the signature match that URL like signing the URL basically, so then if it ends up being a different type of request that a little get caught there so I could see some ways that's being done.

I mean it it exposes a loft that thought process which I think is valuable. I kind of see how you work your way to this fairly complex issue. So starting off with something background with it on OS X and iOS. Basically you have you have the permissions for like an application access the camera needs to have permission to do so. The thing is Apple applications actually. Get that for free. Any Apple application is allowed to access the cameras allowed to basically have some prayer sir. The microphones. The other thing is allowed to access that without actioning to prompt for information. So Safari being an Apple application gets that for free, but it tracks it itself in order to prompt you for for like websites to request specific permission. So going from that that's kind of your background there. Yeah, the that's kind of the security model around. How you get x to the camera? So what this walks through is first of all, it starts looking at how to Safari. Keep track of your website's. How does it know? Why one website is how does it keep track? Thanks for same origin policy and basically they noticed and I'm not going to walk through the entire. An issue, but I'm just going to point out more some highlights, but they noticed in there that when they have like the websites listed, they'd be on like a w-w-w DOT and only example.com would show up. So they kind of notice just how you know, it's probably parsing out for the hostname and what they noticed eventually was that how would parse the host name is it would ignore the protocol so they show the example of going to fake colon slash slash example.com Arm which would count as having example.com open, so it ignored the protocol. So what it did was it would just grab between the colon slash slash and the next / to get the host name? Which kind of makes sense Until you realize that there are some protocols that are supported or pseudo protocols like file / / or blob view Source data things like that or JavaScript would be probably the more common one that don't have a host in it, but it will still load at that same way. Then they kind of talk through how they certain no Singham of some other issues like if you had a domain with a - and a DOT next to each other how it kind of bugs out, but effectively they found for example that they could use file there's a they can use file, you know Skype to Skype.com and it would be loaded as though it's origin was skype.com was the one example that kind of would come up there. However are sorry. They would use JavaScript to change location dot hopes to be skype.com rather than actually doing it in the URL. I'm said they talked about a number of different tricks that they end up using here. So they kind of worked out. So they're able to kind of get control of the origin file while the kind of worked. It doesn't support mobile. So they didn't actually go that route they kind of deep diving into blobs. But what happens with blobs is they end up talking about these opaque origin. So what happens when a blob if you're not familiar with a blob lobs are in JavaScript, you can go and do like a new blob and then give it basically a file that it's going to write and a meta or mime type for it. I can give it that information. Then you can it'll give you a uid that you can then load up as though it were an actual file were an actual URL. So just kind of creates a kind of in memory and you do that with JavaScript. So it's a little bit special. So what happens if you know, how does it get the origin for blobs? and it deep sea dives into that couldn't just You can't just create a blog from skype.com. For example kind of dives into what winds up happening eventually is he figures out that in some cases with The Blob Origins you could end up with a empty origin rather than annul origin or an opaque origin, which just doesn't quite serialize. It actually gets tray is empty were thinks the origin is literally just colon slash slash. so what ends up happening when he's able to trick the origin to be colon slash slash what she ends up only being able to deal with you in theory or he discovered it by only manually typing in the URL not by getting it through any sort of automated means although ends up using another trick to kind of get around that huge using pushstate to effectively change what that Origins up looking like, That ends up happening because you have the colon slash slash as what he thinks. is the origin so then when you use pushstate Interested if you set the push stay to skype.com. We'll just how you change the url without actually changing it's used by gesture. So Ajax stuff, you'll change the url without actually going to make a full request to a new page. You can just change the url kind of magically with JavaScript. That's what pushstate is or part of push States in particular that's changing your history versus replacing I won't go down. Path though, but because of because of finding that blank origin the colon slash slash when he sets the thing to skype.com. It's thinks he's just setting a path not changing the how the other area of safari will actually parse it as the domain being skype.com. Now it thinks it's doing something else. So it sets the path to some like skype.com something that has permission to use the camera. So basically figure out how to programmatically create a document with any sort of spoofed origin is next hurdle was getting around so you can only open the camera webrtc needs to be encrypted needs to be over in theory that's supposed to be needs to be over HTTP and practice files are one place where so file colon slash slash are one place where you'll have I'll say it's not an HTTP request, but you can still open the camera and that's because Safari will trade basically anything that has no origin the file you are eyes data. You are eyes as a secure context and that's obviously there to help developers. That's why files kind of get treated as being as here context even though it's not necessarily secure or at least not here in the sense of being over http. discovers that discovers that you can easily create that sort of opaque or gen using a pop up from a sandbox iframe So if eventually, you know using a pop up from a Sandbox iframe doesn't have any or doesn't have or has an opaque or genset.

It's the language out of their GitHub repo for it. Basically created to provide like a mechanism for various groups of host communicate securely across the internet. so nebula in particular just of this issue is really simple. It uses a relative path. When does executable command? It just uses ifconfig or router on Windows uses netsh. It doesn't give the full path or the absolute path like essman ifconfig. So what that means is if you can control the binaries in the path before it finds the original one you're able to get execute. as a privileged user whatever binary you want it to run. So essentially when you call just for ifconfig, for example your systems going to lock a well as iif, it's quite look at your path environment variable. It's going to get all the folders elf that's going to go in order first folder in there is ifconfig in here. No, OK second folder and there's I've config in there. No, OK third folder. Okay. Here's ifconfig. Let's execute that. So an attacker who can place a binary of the same name somewhere in that path before Actual binaries Falcon get to be run.

Just not so much like it's a little bit uncommon so I can understand that uncommon assuming translate training data where it's just not really there.

But yeah, you know,\", \"start\": 6949.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, I have to imagine like a lot Of these systems are like they don't have the model that Tesla uses. For example, they are basing that's just off of a more generically trained model and so it is worth pointing out like just because they find these issues doesn't mean it's like, oh, well the next test like you buys necessarily going to do the same thing. This is yeah worth worth mentioning that but getting just right down to it. Basically they just mocked up different objects that could be on your roof and well they started by just mocking him up to see what a would get classified as and it actually did a reasonable job at Detecting the vehicle despite the fact that there is also a couch on the roof or a canoe on the roof, which I you could expect reasonably that\", \"start\": 6992.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I don't know.

Do but it looks like you know, the canoe was a little bit malformed or whatever. They found a much greater degree of success like with their adversarial couch. The car would be detected as a couch 68% of the time. So there you are. Just just going down the freeway in your cabinet 54.1% of the time. So yeah, I mean it's it's a straightforward attack here. It's similar to other things we talked about. I just love the idea of you know your self driving car thinking the thing next to you was a cabinet and not a car.\", \"start\": 7052.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I think it's kind of neat because a lot of the adversarial attacks we cover are done intentionally, but this is kind of showing you could do it intentionally, but it's also possible that just very benign things that people do like putting a canoe on top of their car, which I see.

They do directly manipulate that data. I just think they do it in a fair way, you know, they're trying to simulate when you could really do so, I think that's fair like said, you might get pulled over for something unsafe loads, but at the same time You know, you're probably not doing this and just driving down the freeway for hours. It's probably if you were willing to use this and I mean, I don't know if any actual campaign or anything that would have done something like this. Like I guess it wouldn't be a campaign.

But um, yeah this Frac paper specifically it talks about bugs that this researcher found in the FreeBSD beehive hypervisor, which you know, I don't think I've seen much about I don't think it's like very popular but you know anything with hypervisors and stuff is always fun to look at because of how low level it is. And one of the bugs is in the VGA emulation subsystem, and it's an out-of-bounds access. Pallet memory via integer overflow and that memory is used for like pixel entries for DACA dress reading right mode registers. And the problem is they end up using 32-bit indexes when they should have been 8-bit indexes because only values of to hunt to 256 expected and the wraparound is expected on that too. But because they use integers instead of chars or un dates you could actually end up reading or writing out of bounds and because you get those two, To both read and write those two Primitives together very powerful because you can use that to both leak and corrupt Heap data the other bug seem to be unrelated. That was a bug in the firmware configuration device, which allows the guests to retrieve host provided information like the virtual CPU count for example, and it's kind of similar to the first issue its assigned in this issue and one of her Quest structures. So something that should have been unsigned is treated as signed and because of that there's a discrepancy between the allocation a The copy length and you end up getting an overflow this article goes through all the technical details of both vulnerabilities and how the first one can get code execution the second one. They don't go as far as code execution.

My primary use for it has been while working as a consultant, while I've got plenty of security background, I don't always know the intimate details about a particular technology stack. I would turn to Pluralsight to get up-to-speed on a particular topic before an engagement on a new tech stack. The information certainly is available through some Google searches, the conviennce of having everything readily available and there being some baseline standards upheld by PluralSight's instructors did make it a handy tool. I wouldn't consider it a worthwhile investment if you're looking to learn about security, they are lacking in quality security courses, and those that exist are not really worth it in my opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - A lot of PluralSight's security content is focused on web app hacking or network security. While there are a few courses that focus on binary, they're few and far between, and I wouldn't say the subscription is worth it for that alone. Even at the 40% off discount, I'd recommend using the trial to make sure there's enough courses you find interesting before committing to a subscription.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cybermonday-2019.html\">O'Reilly Online Learning</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Annual subscription to the Online Learning program at 50% off ($199)</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - As the name implies, this is an online learning platform, unlike PluralSight, this includes access to books from O'Reilly and other publishers such as No Starch Press and Wiley, two of my favorite tech publishers. One of the most interesting features is the sandbox envrionments they provide (Kubernetes, Python, Tensorflow, and Ubuntu), basically cloud-based VMs running the respective tools that you can access on-demand. They also provide practice tasks and interactive walkthroughs of some basics tasks. While the existing tutorials are quite fundamental, its an interesting setup (using Katacode) that would probably quite useful if you were learning any of the topics covered. For most I think the biggest value comes from the library access and video course access. At roughly $25 a month, its not cheap, but they offer a singificant number of <em>good</em> books, both in general and security related. Basically every book I tend to recommend is on there so its a good library.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://nostarch.com\">No Starch Press</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Last year the deal was 42% off their books, this year hasn't been announced yet, just that they are planning something.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - No Starch is one of my favorite technology and security book publishers. Many of their books are excellent in quality and enjoyable read. You've probably heard of some of their books such as the XYZ Hacker's Handbook series and the Black Hat and Gray hat {language} series among many other non-series books. If they run another steep discount I'll likely be picking up physical copies of Black Hat Go and Serious Cryptography and I'd recommend taking a look at their library, and maybe asking in our Discord for some book recommendations, they have some great content.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/pro\">Pastebin Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - In past years the deal was $20 for the Lifetime Pro Membership. No indication if it will be the same this year.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you use pastebin, its a pretty good deal. If you don't use pastebin, well, you probably won't benefit from this. Pastebin is basically just a simple website to paste text and share it temporarily. The fact its so simple to use and no authentication necessary has lead pastebin being used to exfiltrate or dump data from compromises leading to a secondary feature of pastebin: keyword monitoring. With a Pro account you get access to alerts on certain key words appearing in a paste and the ability to use their API to scrape data. The last feature of Pro is unlimited unlisted and private pastes that don't show up publically. I know many people in the security industry do use pastebin for quick throw away things so I figured it was worth mentioning here.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - The unlimited unlisted and private pastes, the API access, and the larger file limit (10MB as opposed to 500KB) is well worth a lifetime subscription if it's available, however it's not the end of the world if you miss this deal. As zi said, if you're a Pastebin fan, this is probably worth the buy. It's worth noting that there are other paste sites that offer some of what Pastebin pro offers and more for free if you're using Pastebin for it's quick code sharing functionality rather than scraping it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pentesterlab.com/pro\">PentesterLab Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 13.37% off annual subscriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - PentesterLab is another learning platform, this time with a security focus (web application security) and very-much hands on. With a Pro account you get access to a number of web-security 'courses' which are generally short and focused on a single, specific exploit, or attack technique. You are provided with a live, vulnerable envrionment to practice within, as with many things you could go and setup your own VM and attack it yourself, but having one ready for you saves you a ton of time and hassle. I have not used PentesterLab myself so I cnanot comment on the quality of instruction.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/black-friday-2019/\">ProtonMail</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 33-50% off ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - This is another product I've not used, but I know would be of interest to people who care about security. ProtonMail offers End-To-End encrypted email between ProtonMail customers. You can read more about their security features on their website.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.vmware.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=vmware&amp;pbPage=BlackFridaySale\">VMWare Workstation Pro and Fusion pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 35% off Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro, 30% off the non-pro versions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - Running Vms is a constant part of life in the security industry. Maybe I'm running a VM just to have access to some Linux tooling from Windows, or to run some services I'm assessing away from my actual desktop. Whatever the case, VMWare is widely considered the best Desktop VM platform, but its also the most expensive. If you're finding yourself not too happy with Hyper-V, Virtual Box or whatever you use, now would be a good time to atleast checkout VMWare's offering.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - VMWare is a daily driver of mine, so unsurprisingly this is another deal that I recommend people interested in security take, especially if you're planning on doing research into kernel development / exploitation, and/or malware research. Between VirtualBox, HyperV, and VMWare, I've found VMWare to be the most performant. The pro editions also allow you to use snapshots which are valuable to quickly get back to work when working on things that could end up crashing the kernel a lot (such as driver development or exploits).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.hak5.org/\">Hak5</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various discounts on the Hak5 store.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you have a need for their products now is a good time to buy or upgrade to a newer model, if you don't have a need I'd recommend skipping. Hak5 is fairly well known for the Pineapple and for their numerous hacking tools, everything is always pretty decent quality and often has some quality of life improvements over whatever you might make yourself with off-the-shell components. The thing is, for a lot of people they see these things and think about how 'cool' they are or how much of a 'hacker' they'd be if they had it without actually considering any practical usecase. Meaning many purchases just become novelty items collecting dusts on a shelf after a few months. If you have an immediate and known use for them, go ahead and pick something up, but don't waste your money if you don't yet know how you'd use the tools. Its very much for professionals in the sense that the average peope just isn't going to be in a situation to be dropping a rogue AP into a corporate network but a professional might.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/blog/vault-will-open-black-friday-cyber-monday/\">NameCheap</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various hosting and domain related deals</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you want a vanity domain, there are usually good discounts going on and some cheap hosting. Not sure about the quality of hosting through NameCheap, but I've registered a few domains with them without any issues.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com\">LowEndBox</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various deals from hosting providers</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - I like to pick up a cheap server ever now and again just to run little scripts, or apps away from my main servers. I wouldn't trust these deals for anything meant for production, but having a server to run some long running scripts/bots/scanners on is nice, and LowEndBox will usually list some very good deals. One of my better deals was a VPS at $60 for 3 years that I've been running a service that is publically used on for nearly 6 years now. Now is also a good time to check with your favorite host to find deals.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","slug":"black-friday-for-security-professionals"}},{"node":{"title":"Episode 16 - A Bit of everything: 0days, Breaches, Lawsuits, Attacking AI, and some insecure","path":"/posts/episode-16-a-bit-of-everything-0days-breaches-lawsuits-attacking-ai-and-some-insecure/","date":"5 November 2019","description":"   ","content":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeb7IMo7XMM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Watch the podcast live every Monday afternoon at 12:00pm PST (3:00pm EST) on Twitch <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/dayzerosec\">(@Dayzerosec)</a></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeb7IMo7XMM&amp;t=00h05m23s\">00:05:23</a>] Apple v.
